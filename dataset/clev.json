    "headline": "WIKILEAKS CLAIM: Hillary Gave Weapons To ISIS",
    "content": "Hillary Clinton is being accused of knowingly allowing American weapons into the hands of ISIS terrorists.\n\nWeapons that Hillary Clinton sent off to Qatar ostensibly designed to give to the rebels in Libya eventually made their way to Syria to assist the overthrow of the Assad regime. The folks fighting against Assad were ISIS and al-Qaeda jihadists.\n\nIt’s a long and rather convoluted shipment of weapons that – according to Wikileaks’ Julian Assange – Hillary Clinton was well aware of.\n\nIt’s a part of the massive e-mail dump that Wikileaks has from Hillary Clinton. Assange claims that among the 1,700 emails just released, there is proof that – despite what she told Congress – she knew about the flow of weapons from Qatar to Libya and then to Syrian rebels and terrorists.\n\nOn the show “Democracy Now!” Assange explained what the whole point of the e-mail dump was:\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what’s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base? JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn’t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it’s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case—or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilization can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilization is. We can’t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand. So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails. There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.\n\nSo it seems like Hillary Clinton may have committed perjury – again. Back in 2013, Sen. Rand Paul grilled Clinton about her knowledge of weapons making their way into Syria:\n\nRELATED: Even Democrat Feinstein Thinks Congress Should Investigate Loretta Lynch\n\nSen. Rand Paul: My question is, is the US involved in any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya? Hillary Clinton: To Turkey? I’ll have to take that question for the record. That’s, nobody’s ever raised that with me. Sen. Rand Paul: It’s been in news reports that ships have been leaving from Libya and that they may have weapons. And what I’d like to know is, that annex that was close by, were they involved with procuring, buying, selling, obtaining weapons and were any of these weapons being transferred to other countries? Any countries, Turkey included? Hillary Clinton: Well, Senator you’ll have to direct that question to the agency that ran the annex. And, I will see what information was available. Sen. Rand Paul: You’re saying you don’t know? Hillary Clinton: I do not know. I don’t have any information on that.\n\nIf Assange is correct, this is catastrophically bad news for Clinton.\n\nH/T: PamelaGeller.com\n\nALERT: How To Be Sure To Continue Seeing Our Content On Facebook.\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers' newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources.

    "headline": "President Obama Confirms He Will Refuse To Leave Office If Trump Is Elected",
    "content": "Barack Obama has sensationally told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that he will NOT vacate the Oval office if Donald J. Trump is elected the 45th President of the United States.\n\nThe current president claims he is “fully prepared” to ignore the popular vote if it means stopping Trump, having found what he believes is a little known loophole that would allow him to remain in charge until a re-election is called.\n\n“As president, I must do what I feel is in the best interests of our nation,” he explained. “If the American people elected ‘the Donald’ then I will be forced to take whatever actions I deem necessary.”\n\nWhen asked by the CNN anchor if he would remain in charge, Obama’s response was firm. “I am not standing down as president if it means four years of President Trump,” he said categorically.\n\nThe president was asked what exact lengths he would go to, to prevent the billionaire from being sworn in on January, 20th, 2017. “I am prepared to file a motion of ‘no confidence’ in our citizens thereby taking their vote away from them,” he confessed.\n\n“Wait, you’re willing to impeach the American people as voters?” a possibly stunned Blitzer asked. “Yes, if necessary,” the President responded. “I cannot allow him into this chair, with his finger so close to the button. The power would go to his head immediately.”\n\nObama even suggested he will barricade himself and his family inside the White House if it means stopping the Trump family from taking up residency there. “I’ve instructed the Secret Service to use full force in defending the White House from the Trump family. Joe has already expressed his willingness to die multiple times in order to keep them out of here.”\n\nWhen questioned by Howard Stern, Trump seemed unconcerned by the President’s stance. “Don’t worry, we’ll get some of the second amendment people to sort him out pretty quickly.”\n\nWhich side are you on… Team Obama or Team Trump? Join the debate on Obama refusing to leave on Facebook, Twitter and now… Linkedin",

    "content": "A review of FBI Director James Comey’s professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader — now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton — is deeply entrenched in the big-money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships — all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton — reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe.\n\n⇓VIDEO BELOW⇓\n\nThese concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comey’s former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner’s board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation’s taxes.\n\nLockheed Martin\n\nWhen President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in 2013, Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers.\n\nBut Comey earned $6 million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year.\n\nComey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel.\n\nHow much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in 2010? More than $6 million in compensation.\n\nLockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in 2010.\n\nAccording to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton $250,000 to deliver a speech in 2010.\n\nIn 2010, Lockheed Martin won 17 approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department.\n\nHSBC Holdings\n\nIn 2013, Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings.\n\n“Mr. Comey’s appointment will be for an initial three-year term which, subject to re-election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the 2016 Annual General Meeting,” according to HSBC company records.\n\nHSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to “retrofit 1,500 to 2,500 housing units, primarily in the low- to moderate-income sector” in “New York City.”\n\n“Retrofitting” refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected “$1 billion in financing” for this Green initiative to conserve people’s energy in low-income housing units.\n\nWho Is Peter Comey?\n\nWhen our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for “Peter Comey,” a receptionist immediately put him through to Comey’s direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website.\n\nPeter Comey serves as “Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas” for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing.\n\nDLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton-World’s first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA Piper’s employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base.\n\nDLA Piper ranks #5 on Hillary Clinton’s all-time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnd here is another thing: Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director.\n\nPeter Comey’s financial records, obtained by Breitbart News, show that he bought a $950,000 house in Vienna, Virginia, in June 2008. He needed a $712,500 mortgage from First Savings Mortgage Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut on January 31, 2011, James Comey and his wife stepped in to become Private Party lenders. They granted a mortgage on the house for $711,000. Financial records suggest that Peter Comey took out two such mortgages from his brother that day.\n\nThis financial relationship between the Comey brothers began prior to James Comey’s nomination to become director of the FBI.\n\nDLA Piper did not answer any question as to whether James Comey and Peter Comey spoke at any point about this mortgage or anything else during the Clinton email investigation.",

    "headline": "Was Hillary Wearing an Earpiece During Last Night’s Presidential Forum?",
    "content": "UPDATE: Hillary Clinton’s campaign has denied she was wearing an earpiece.\n\n“Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash,” reports Fox News.\n\n——————–\n\nWas Hillary Clinton wearing an earpiece during last night’s presidential forum? That’s the latest question swirling around the Internet after pictures appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear.\n\nConservative actor James Woods drew attention the issue with the simple question, “Earpiece?” and a close up image of Hillary from last night’s forum.\n\nWoods also posted a Clinton email from the Wikileaks archive in which Huma Abedin asked Hillary, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”\n\n“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece,” tweeted Woods.\n\n“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial,” added Woods, linking to an article by TruePundit which reported that Hillary was wearing an earpiece to receive “stealth coaching” during the NBC live town hall event.\n\n“NYPD sources involved with the NBC forum’s security detail confirm Clinton was wearing an ‘inductive earpiece,” the same technology employed by almost all lead Broadway actors to receive forgotten lines and stealth off-stage cues from directors. The flesh-colored earbud is easily concealed. There are no wires running directly to the ear like you see with the units employed by Secret Service protection detail personnel,” claimed the article.\n\nThe report goes on to provide technical details about the earpiece, asserting that it is “almost invisible to anyone” and is “normally issued to law enforcement or corporate security teams.”\n\nBOMBSHELL: Enhanced Video Clearly Shows #HillarysEarpiece, Confirming EXCLUSIVE #TruePundit.com NYPD Source Intel RT pic.twitter.com/sNLRcyQHWe — Thomas Paine (@Thomas1774Paine) September 8, 2016\n\nThe story also drew almost a thousand comments over on The Donald subreddit, with one user commenting, “Either she admits a health issue and says she’s deaf or she admits to cheating.”\n\n“I commented earlier during the Town Hall saying her responses seemed a little slower than normal. Now it all makes sense,” responded another.\n\nSome Liberals in denial about #HillarysEarpiece. Here's more proof she was being fed answers at #NBCNewsForum. Zoom! pic.twitter.com/IYBfTp6tiv — ALWAYS TRUMP! (@Always_Trump) September 8, 2016\n\nAnother user remarked that Hillary appeared to be uttering broken sentences such as “I think that’s an ex—- actly right way to proceed.”\n\nThis is not the first time Clinton has faced charges that she was wearing an earpiece during a crucial event – similar claims were made after her appearance in front of the House Select Benghazi Hearing in October last year.\n\nOf course, the earpiece could have just been a hearing aid, although there doesn’t appear to be any admission or record of Hillary wearing one in the past.\n\nOthers claims it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. You be the judge.\n\nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:\n\nFollow on Twitter: Follow @PrisonPlanet\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71\n\n*********************\n\nPaul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com.",

    "content": "Breaking: POKER PRO AGREES – Hillary Was Sending Hand Signals to Debate Moderator Holt\n\nHillary Clinton is not above cheating, lying or stealing to get what she wants.\n\nSo it shouldn’t be any surprise that she is being accused of cheating during Monday’s 1st Presidential debate.\n\nClinton was accused of cheating by sending hand signals to the moderator Lester Holt.\n\nDuring the debate when Clinton wanted to signal Holt whent she wanted the floor, she rubbed her face in a manner similar to a baseball manager.\n\nAccording to True Pundit she has not done this in any other debates during her career supporting the accusation that these were signals.\n\nWatch this incredible video before passing judgement–\n\n(the first video was pulled. Here is a copy)\n\n\n\nAuthor and journalist Mike Cernovich reached out to poker pros to see if Hillary was signalling Lester Holt with hand gestures during Monday’s debate.\n\nCurious. Do the poker pros like @themouthmatusow see this as a “signal” to moderator Lestor Holt. https://t.co/3uQbpbhSQe — Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) September 28, 2016\n\nPoker pro Mike Matusow agreed– Hillary was signalling Lester Holt.\n\nWow ive watched the debates 3 times & never noticed!! I felt the whole time she had the questions but after watching that i she def signals https://t.co/dOSZlmfB9G — Mike Matusow (@themouthmatusow) September 28, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nMore…\n\nI know they were desperate & i do agree its the same scratch and look at holt everytime #crookedHillary #Debates2016 https://t.co/dOSZlmfB9G — Mike Matusow (@themouthmatusow) September 28, 2016\n\nUPDATE: AFter TGP posted this story earlier today the video was pulled on YouTube due to complaints.\n\nI am fairly certain because of the nature of this video it was not violating any copyright agreements.\n\nMerlin SC Distribution had the video pulled.",

    "headline": "96% of the Clintons’ 2015 Charitable Donations Were to Clinton Foundation",
    "content": "96 percent of the roughly one million dollars given to charity by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 2015 was given to the Clinton Family Foundation, a tax-exempt charity controlled by the Clintons.\n\nAccording to the tax return released by the Clinton campaign Friday, Desert Classic Charities received $42,000 from the Clintons while the Clinton Family Foundation received a cool million. But as the Daily Caller points out, The Desert Classic Charities in turn contributed $700,000 to the second Clinton charity, the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe Clintons’ charitable work has been the source of controversy ever since the publication of the 2015 book Clinton Cash, which alleged that many of the other Clinton Foundation’s big donations from foreign and domestic actors coincided with beneficial decisions by Hillary Clinton’s State Department. The Clinton campaign has hotly denied those allegations as pure speculation without any evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, The Daily Caller reports Friday that FBI has started multiple probes into the second Clinton Foundation with the help of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York. That report comes after CNN reported Wednesday that the Justice Department had turned down the FBI’s request to open a probe into the potential conflict of interest.\n\nUPDATE (3:47 PM ET): Originally, this piece reported that the Clintons donated to “the Clinton Foundation,” fullstop. However, the charitable donation went to the Clinton Family Foundation, while “the Clinton Foundation” is more commonly used in press reports to refer to controversy surrounding the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. This piece has been edited to make the distinction clearer.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n——\n\n>>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know? [email protected]",

    "content": "PRESIDENT Obama has admitted for the first time, that he and his family are “seriously considering” moving to Canada if Donald Trump is elected the 46th president of the United States. The news comes after Obama launched a scathing attack on Trump,calling him“woefully unprepared” and “unfit to be president”.\n\nThe current U.S. president was speaking to the White House press corps when he expressed his “deep disappointment” with the republican party’s nominee, leading him and the First Lady to explore other options. “It’s something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald,” he said. “I have also spoken with Prime Minister Trudeau who outlined Canada’s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we’ll see.”\n\nThe Obama’s had been expected to stay in Washington DC at least until daughter Sasha had graduated from high school. However in the event Trump’s elected,Obama told reporters that his family will likely move directly to Canada. “Their education system is clearly a lot better than ours anyway,” he accepted, shaking his head. “Canadians would never elect someone as buffoonish and incompetent as Donald Trump, at least outside Toronto.”\n\nHowever a potential “President Trump” is not the Obama family’s only reason for considering the move north of the border. According to the outgoing president, “Canada is clearly a much safer place for a black person, especially one who’s surrounded by police 24/7.”\n\nWith him seemingly ruling out a move to Toronto, Obama also dismissed suggestions he could be tempted to move to Vancouver. “Honestly, I don’t really think we can afford to buy a place in Vancouver on a former U.S. president’s salary.”\n\nWhat do you think about Obama moving to Canada?",

    "content": "Reddit Email 13K Shares\n\nBefore running against billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump for the presidency, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an audience at a private, paid speech she wanted to see more successful businessmen and women run for office because they can’t be bought.\n\nIn a speech made public by Wikileaks – which released an email from Hillary for America Research Director Tony Caark containing three attached speeches given at a private Goldman Sachs events – Clinton spoke and took audience questions at the “Builders and Innovators Summit” hosted by Goldman Sachs on October 29, 2013.\n\nAnswering a question about businessmen in politics, Clinton said that they are “most often the people that look over the horizon,” and therefore share a vision that many politicians of today lack.\n\n“And that’s a very good question and thank you for asking it. Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what we’re used to seeing traditionally,” she opined.\n\nAnd then she just had to go on. “In fact, when you say businessmen and women, I can’t help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future,” Clinton added. “I don’t know what it is exactly about him, I can’t quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And it’s telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future.”\n\nAsked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen “can’t be bought” and that they’re “very honest.” “And I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician,” she praised her current counter-candidate.\n\n“I think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when we’re talking about the economy,” she continued. “Donald Trump has single-handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so-called billionaires. And I don’t know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book that’s hard evidence of the man’s business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally.”\n\n“So, yes – Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I don’t think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills – which are both things he’s known for – but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all – I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points.\n\nI think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him,” she ominously concluded in her 2013 speech.\n\nVia The Rightists",

    "headline": "BREAKING: Department of Homeland Security Chairman Officially Indicts Hillary Clinton Of TREASON",
    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security just went on the air with Fox News and told the American People that Hillary Clinton is guilty of treason.\n\nIn the damning announcement, Department of Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that Hillary Clinton clearly acted against the multiple security warnings she received while Secretary of State.\n\nFurthermore, he went on to release that Hillary Clinton took multiple devices overseas. Not only that, these devices were proven to be hacked by China, Russia, and the Islamic State of Iran.\n\nThe intent is clear. Hillary Clinton used the secret server to hide her actions from the American People. She committed pure treason against the United States. Here is the full video:\n\nObama was also involved in the highly illegal email activity. He even used an alias to help protect his identity. FBI security experts easily cracked the alias, revealing hundreds of secret conversations between Obama and Hillary about foreign and domestic policy!\n\nAnd now that the FBI has found massive evidence that Hillary used the Clinton Foundation to make millions, it means the email server was undoubtedly used to rob the American People.\n\nWhat’s worse, Daily Mail reported on the WikiLeak that Hillary and Obama’s Chief of Staff John Podesta were warned ahead of time of the impending investigations. Because of this, they were able to delete and acid-wash all of the 33,000 emails just 5 days before her trial!\n\nThe actions of Clinton go far beyond political corruption. They show a clear and decisive intent to destroy American Justice and Democracy. And it’s not just Hillary Clinton. Our very own Commander in Chief was involved the entire time.\n\nOh, and the Department of Justice is being led by Loretta Lynch, who secretly met with Bill Clinton on a landing Strip in Phoenix mere days before Hillary was acquitted! As of today, Lynch is being sued to disclose the details of the meeting.\n\nWhen the American Constitution was crafted, a very meaningful and necessary clause was added:\n\n“that, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government”\n\nWe are now on the forefront of what our grandchildren will come to know as the Second American Revolution. The government is no longer of the people; instead, corrupt officials use citizens as pawns in a twisted game of death and destruction.\n\nTruly, the fate of our nation will be decided in just five short days.",

    "content": "Home » Breaking News, Crimes, North America, Theft » Hillary Clinton’s “Sudden Move” Of $1.8 Billion To Qatar Central Bank Stuns Financial World\n\nAn intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were “stunned/bewildered” a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)—and for reasons yet to be firmly established. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world’s oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia.\n\nWith Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains “complete/all times/all ways” surveillance of him and his criminal associates—including both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton, and who are collectively designated as the “Clinton Crime Family”.\n\nOn Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton’s Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City—and who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon’s, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company’s stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line—and that caused JP Morgan’s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010.\n\nWithin 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank.\n\nTo why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who “oversaw/managed” the “massive bribery scheme” that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup—and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present—bringing Hillary Clinton’s total “cash grab” from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million—all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton’s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS.\n\nTo what Jamie Dimon “related/said to” Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this “megabanks” master plan to save itself had “serious deficiencies” that could “pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States”.\n\nTwo months after the FDIC’s warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically “sounded a warning” that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that “someone is going to get hurt”.\n\nUnbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse—and that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that “this market is scary”, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a “Red Alert” warning all of its clients warning them to “prepare for a severe market crash”.\n\nWith one of the first “victims/casualties” of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is “nearing its doom” and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe—who unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers.\n\nAs Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the “Clinton Crime Story of the Century”, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.\n\nAnd rather than the US propaganda mainstream media warning the American people of their economies looming destruction, this report concludes, they have, instead, begun a “systemic mainstream misinformation” campaign to manipulate the presidential election polls showing Hillary Clinton leading—but that stands opposed to actual (but unreported) polls showing Donald Trump leading.\n\nCritical Note: A highly classified SVR amendment to this MoF report states that upon Qatar receiving Hillary Clinton’s $1.8 billion earlier today, one of that sheikdoms royal places was “ordered emptied” in preparation for the “early November arrival” of a “high value” dignitary—Hillary Clinton perhaps?\n\nSource\n\nRate this

    "content": "Home » Breaking News, Crimes, North America, Politics, Videos » Russia Asks CIA: Why Did Hillary Clinton Just Buy $137 Million Worth Of Illegal Arms?\n\nA stunning Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today reveals that the Security Council (SC), this morning, authorized the sending to the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of an emergency communiqué requesting an immediate explanation as to why Hillary Clinton’s money laundering organization, known as the Clinton Foundation, this past week, purchased over $137 million of illegal arms and ammunition—and whose destination is to be the United States, with delivery being marked as “mid-November 2016”. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, SVR analysts began expressing “urgent concern” earlier this year when the main “elements/factions” of the feared Viktor Bout’s international arms smuggling crime organization began arriving in the Republic of Albania—that is the only Muslim nation in Europe.\n\nViktor Bout, this report explains, is most popularly known in the West as the “Lord of War” for his workings with the CIA to smuggle illegal weapons throughout the world to further the maniacal interests of the United States—until 2011 when then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had him jailed.\n\nThough a citizen of the Federation, this report continues, the SVR had no “complaint/concern” with Hillary Clinton having Bout jailed for 25 years as it was an internal matter of the CIA—but whose intelligence analysts expressed “worry/confusion” this past May (2016) when US Federal Judge Shira Scheindlin said he should have had a reduced sentence—and that led, yesterday, to Bout “suddenly/magically” being transferred out of maximum security to the “country club atmosphere” of the general ward of the US Federal Prison he’s been confined to.\n\nCoinciding with Bout’s “mysterious/magical” prison transfer yesterday, this report notes, was Hillary Clinton’s money laundering Clinton Foundation transferring $137.7 million to the Socialist Party of Albania (SPA) controlled by that nations Prime Minister Edi Rama—who is not only the head of the Xhakja Clan (known in the West as the Albanian Mafia) but who was, also, and shockingly, put into power by the Obama-Clinton regime over the protests of the Albanian people who did not want a “mafia government” controlling them.\n\nWith Hillary Clinton’s international arms merchant Prime Minister Rama having turned the entire Balkan region into one of the world’s largest areas for arms smuggling that now threatens its very security, this report warns, she has been aided in this effort by what many are calling her “puppet master”—the Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros that recently released, and shocking, secret emails show him ordering Hillary Clinton to install this mafia criminal as the leader of Albania.\n\nTo fully understand why Hillary Clinton made this massive arms purchase, and no doubt was aided in doing so by the CIA’s arms smuggler Viktor Bout, SVR analysts in this report explain, is her adherence to George Soros’s radical vision of open borders—and that he singlehandedly began implementing by creating the European refugee crisis that will, likewise, engulf the United States should Hillary Clinton become president, and as exactly as her secret emails reveals she plans on doing.\n\nAlso, this report continues, and as the Federation knows all to well, the Soros-Clinton “master plan” to take down a nation begins with the establishment of what are called Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) to act as a “shadow government” ready to take power once the established order is thrown into chaos by massive protests—and why, in 2013, President Putin banned them from operating in Russia.\n\nIn the United States, however, this report grimly states, the American people have no defense against these “shadow government” NGO’s—and that SVR intelligence assests have documented in this report as being the “receiving parties” of Hillary Clinton’s massive arms purchase and include the George Soros created NGO’s called: Open Society Foundations, Media Matters, American Institute for Social Justice, The New America Foundation, The Migration Policy Institute, Tides Foundation, Center for American Progress, and the Democracy Alliance—every single one of which stands violently opposed to the US Constitution and the American people.\n\nOnce these weapons are in the hands of Hillary Clinton’s “new revolutionaries”, this report continues, they will then be used to unleash a “terror wave” across America protesting Donald Trump’s landslide victory—thus enabling President Obama to declare martial law to disarm all of these people, and once doing so, allow the US Electors to place Hillary Clinton in power. [Note: American presidents are NOT elected by the voting of citizens, but by the vote of the Electors selected from each of that nations 50 States.]\n\nThis report sadly concludes, though, by noting that the massive vote fraud already being committed by Hillary Clinton’s “new revolutionaries” throughout the United States, and that led this past week to former US Congressman Joe Walsh stunningly stating “If Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket”—a reference to one of the darkest times in American history when that nation’s ordinary citizens banded together to fight the British Empire for their freedom—should strike fear into all Americans of what Hillary Clinton’s “new revolutionaries” are doing right now—and if not, nothing will.\n\nSource\n\nRate this item: 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 Submit Rating Rating: 5.0/5.

    "headline": "Military Officials Furious After Hillary Lets Out Nuclear Response Time During Debate",
    "content": "During Wednesday night’s third and final Presidential debate, democratic nominee Hillary Clinton let out a secret piece of information on live television with tens of millions watching worldwide. While trying to claim her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, would be unfit to be Commander-in-Chief, Hillary Clinton divulged the precise nuclear response time, a piece of information only known by a handful of very top officials within the United States government.\n\nWhile the piece of information has been speculated on for years, formerly being estimated at eight minutes this is the first time a high-level former official has publicly stated it.\n\n“But here’s the deal,” Clinton told moderator Chris Wallace. “The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There’s about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.”\n\nAccording to Pentagon sources, the information that Clinton broadcasted is Top Secret intelligence governed under the U.S. Special Access Program (SAP). The details of the nuclear response time is reportedly only known by “need to know” (NTK) officials.\n\n. ADVERTISEMENT .\n\n\n\nNTK Officials consist of the following:\n\nPresident Vice President Secretary of State Secretary of Defense Secretary of Homeland Security Attorney General Director of National Intelligence CIA Director Deputy Secretary of State Deputy Secretary of Defense Special personnel designated solely by the President in writing\n\nHillary Clinton’s team also tweeted the information during the debate:\n\nThey then took it a step further by using the top secret information in a jab against Donald Trump:\n\n[revad2]\n\n",

    "headline": "John Kasich Tells GOP Chair Reince Priebus To Go F*ck Himself",
    "content": "Reince Priebus openly threatened Kasich and other Republicans that they better blindly support Donald Trump or face the end of their careers. John Kasich doesn’t give a shit about Priebus’ pathetic threats.\n\nOn Sunday, the GOP Chair suggested that Republicans who don’t fall in line behind Trump could be severely punished in their endeavors to seek election or re-election.\n\n“Those people need to get on board,” Priebus told Face The Nation:\n\n“And if they’re thinking they’re going to run again someday, I think that we’re going to evaluate the process — of the nomination process and I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for them. In order to be on the ballot in South Carolina, you actually have to pledge your support to the nominee, no matter who that person is. So what’s the penalty for that? It’s not a threat, but that’s just the question that we have a process in place.”\n\nKasich has repeatedly refused to endorse Donald Trump and did not take kindly to Priebus’ threat, issuing a brutal response through his spokesman John Weaver.\n\n“Thankfully, there are still leaders in this country who put principles before politics. The idea of a greater purpose beyond oneself may be alien to political party bosses like Reince Priebus, but it is at the center of everything Governor Kasich does…The Governor is traveling the nation supporting down ballot Republicans and preventing a potential national wipeout from occurring on Reince’s watch.”\n\nWeaver also added that Priebus should be thanking Kasich.\n\nSo the next time John Kasich seeks re-election or high office it’s going to be interesting to watch how Priebus responds. Will he follow through on his threat or will he do an about-face and all of a sudden support Kasich?\n\nThreatening someone with political ruin just because they don’t support the terrible choice of nominee your party made sounds more like what dictators or fascists do. It’s definitely not the hallmark of a party that supposedly supports our democracy. Because by trying to force Republicans to vote a certain way, they are undermining democracy and all the values this country was founded upon.\n\nIf anyone deserves political backlash, it’s Reince Priebus. He created a political atmosphere so toxic that they now have Trump as their leader. The Republicans standing against Trump are the sane ones.\n\nFeatured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",

    "headline": "Michigan Republicans Strip Flint Of Their Power To Sue The State Over Poisoned Water",
    "content": "The city of Flint, Michigan is suffering through a horrible man-made disaster that could have been easily prevented if state Republicans hadn’t been so careless.\n\nAfter placing Flint under state control, officials chose to save money by switching the city’s drinking water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, which has not been the drinking water source for decades because it was poisoned and considered unsafe for human consumption.\n\nAs a result, the city has been devastated by lead poisoning, which will have terrible consequences for years to come for the children who ingested the tainted water.\n\nUnderstandably, Flint is mad as hell so they decided to take the state to court. But because Michigan Republicans and Governor Rick Snyder are rats who hate democracy and justice, they shut down any potential lawsuit by stripping Flint of the power to sue.\n\nAccording to the Detroit Free Press:\n\nThough Flint has not been under a state-appointed emergency manager since April 2015, the state still exerts partial control over the city through a five-member Receivership Transition Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder. The board moved quickly to change the rules under which Flint is governed so that the city cannot file a lawsuit without first getting approval from that state-appointed board.\n\nThis is absolutely outrageous. It’s like a woman having to get permission to file a lawsuit from the company whose CEO raped her.\n\nMichigan Republicans should not have the power to take away anyone’s right to seek redress through the court system. It sounds like they are just scared that they will lose the case. And frankly, they should be.\n\nAfter all, it was their decisions that led to Flint being poisoned with tainted water and the cover-up that followed. The city of Flint absolutely should be able to sue the state in open court. But Republicans took that power away from Flint, and you can be damn sure that they would love to do that in every city across all fifty states if they have their way.\n\nFeatured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",

    "headline": "Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context",
    "content": "I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:\n\nBill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors\n\nHere’s Google:\n\nNaturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”\n\nOf course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\n\n“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\n\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters\n\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:\n\nJournalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.\n\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\n\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.",

    "headline": "Trump Just Blamed Bombings On ‘Freedom Of The Press’ (VIDEO)",
    "content": "Donald Trump appeared on Fox & Friends Monday morning and blamed the weekend attacks in New Jersey and New York City on refugees, a lack of profiling by law enforcement, and the First Amendment. Conservatives always go right past that First Amendment and only abide by the Second.\n\nTrump took aim at refugees; however, bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, is a naturalized citizen.\n\nA Fox & Friends host asked Trump what he would do to stop “people who are radicalized here.” Trump responded to that by saying “freedom of the press” was to blame.\n\n“They’re all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, it’s called ‘freedom of the press,’ where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw,” Trump said. “They tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because they’re participating in crime. Instead they say ‘oh no you can’t do anything, that’s freedom of expression.’”\n\n“The websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. They’re inciting violence, okay?” he continued. “They’re making violence possible. They should be arrested immediately…yet we don’t want to touch them because of freedom of speech.”\n\nWatch at around the 21 minute mark:\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GTRabASaY8]\n\nHowever, incitement is already an exception to the First Amendment.\n\nThink Progress reports:\n\nIt’s a high bar to prove — for which Trump may have reason to be personally grateful. Under a laxer rule, it’s possible that Trump could be charged for incitement himself. In August, his statement that “Second Amendment people” could be able to do something about Hillary Clinton was met with widespread condemnation as a veiled assassination threat. On Friday, he called for Clinton’s bodyguards to “disarm immediately,” adding “let’s see what happens to her.”\n\nDonald has attacked Freedom of the Press many times. Most recently, his campaign had a VICE reporter arrested. The GOP presidential nominee has gone as far as to defend Vladimir Putin for killing journalists.\n\nTrump said of Putin after being confronted by Joe Scarborough over the Russian leader’s bloody history with journalists, “He’s running his country, and at least he’s a leader. Unlike what he have in this country.”\n\nFreedom of the Press is part of our Constitution. It’s not up for debate, unless Melania Trump feels like suing bloggers for quoting from a source.\n\nBut if you ask Donald Trump Jr., he’ll tell you that political correctness is to blame for terrorist attacks.\n\nIronically, Junior’s pinned tweet reads, “Liberals love the first amendment until you say something they don’t agree with.”\n\nHe really should change that.\n\nFeatured image via Brian Blanco via Getty.",

    "content": "Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:\n\n“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”\n\nBut he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:\n\nLast weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nPay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”\n\nNow, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”\n\n“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”\n\nIf Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?\n\nThese are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.\n\nNormally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.\n\nIf we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.\n\nFeatured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle",

Because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution say so.\n\nBut Republican nominee Donald Trump thinks the amendments should be scrapped in Rahami’s case. You know, because he’s a Muslim.\n\nDuring a rally in Florida on Monday, Trump whined because Rahami is being treated in a hospital for his wound and further complained about him being represented by a competent defense attorney.\n\n“Now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world. He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer. His case will go through the various court systems for years and in the end, people will forget and his punishment will not be what it once would have been. What a sad situation.”\n\nTrump, who advocates for torture techniques, also demanded a speedy trial resulting in “harsh punishment” and suggested using “whatever lawful methods are available to obtain information from the apprehended suspect to get information before it’s no longer timely.”\n\nHere’s the video via YouTube.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment states:\n\nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury…nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\nRahami is innocent until proven guilty. So not letting him get the treatment he needs could lead to him dying from an infection or loss of blood, thus depriving him of life without due process.\n\nFurthermore, the Sixth Amendment clearly gives everyone the right to an attorney, even a bombing suspect.\n\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\n\nThe right to have an attorney is one of the most foundational values of the country, most exemplified by Founding Father John Adams, who defended the British soldiers who were arrested after the Boston Massacre in 1770.\n\nIn short, it doesn’t matter who the suspect is or what they did, they have the right to due process and an attorney in this country. But Donald Trump apparently wants to put a “white’s only” sign on the Constitution.\n\nFeatured image via screen capture",

    "content": "Guess who George H.W. Bush is voting for? He lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, and his son is George W. Bush. Yet it seems that the elder Bush finds Trump so distasteful a candidate that he’s actually going to cast his vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccording to Politico, Bush Sr. had originally planned on keeping quiet about this election. Considering the fact that he’s a Republican, and therefore expected to weigh in on the side of the Republicans’ chosen candidate, this is actually pretty major. But it wasn’t Bush himself who revealed his vote. It was Kathleen Kennedy Townsend—daughter of the late Robert Kennedy—who let this particular interesting tidbit slip:\n\n“On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: ‘The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!'”\n\nShe stood by that later on when talking to Politico. According to her, George H.W. Bush would rather vote for his former rival and successor’s wife than the god-awful train wreck that is Donald Trump.\n\nA spokesman for the Bush family refused to actually confirm this – he said that George H.W.’s vote is a private decision and will remain so. He himself isn’t commenting, but it seems that those who are in his inner circle aren’t being so tight-lipped, if Kennedy is to be believed.\n\nBush Sr. did make it clear back in May that he had absolutely zero intention of endorsing Trump. That’s a bold, but wise, move for any Republican, since Republicans are supposed to be on the side of freedom and Trump is on the side of dictatorship and authoritarianism.\n\nHis love of Russian president Vladimir Putin would suggest that he’s also on the side of autocracy. None of these three things meshes with the democracy Republicans say we’ve built in even the smallest way.\n\nEarlier in the summer, an administration official for George W. Bush announced that she would vote for Hillary, adding her name to an ever-growing list of Republicans and conservatives who can’t find it within themselves to support Trump. Jeb Bush has said he can neither vote for Hillary nor Trump.\n\nA former Republican president refusing to stand for the current Republican nominee is a stinging blow indeed.\n\nFeatured image by Scott Halleran/Getty Images",

    "headline": "Trump Campaign Gives PATHETIC Reason Why George H.W. Bush Is Voting For Hillary (VIDEO)",
    "content": "Months ago, former First Lady Laura Bush shocked Americans when she said she’d rather vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton than a Republican this election. For the most part, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush have opted to stay out of this election – until now.\n\nWord of George H.W. Bush’s decision to snub the GOP by not voting for its disastrous Republican nominee just recently broke, and it’s a super provocative move because not only is Bush refusing to support his party, but he is voting for the Democratic Party instead. It’s a controversial decision, but obviously Bush recognizes that it’s the smartest choice for the future of this country.\n\nThe Trump campaign, as you can imagine, isn’t taking this lightly. In an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reacted to the elder Bush’s voting decision and couldn’t have demonstrated any better how immature and bitter the campaign was about it.\n\nConway said that although she ‘respects’ Bush’s choice, it’s ironic that he’s voting for “the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race” in 1992. Conway also chalked up Bush’s decision to vote for Clinton to his emotions and “hurt feelings” over his son’s loss to Trump in the primaries. She said:\n\n“This was a bruising primary, and Jeb Bush really failed all expectations… I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there.”\n\nYou can watch the interview below:\n\n“Jeb Bush really failed…there are a lot of hurt feelings” @KellyannePolls on Bush 41 voting #Clinton https://t.co/iyhiLRgrPL\n\nThis response from the Trump campaign is exactly what we’d expect it to be. The Bush family is making a responsible, informed decision during this election, and that is way too much for Trump and his minions to wrap their feeble minds around. This election is no joke – it’s about far more than Republican and Democrat parties. It’s about saving the country from a candidate that will destroy it – and the Bush’s are smart enough to recognize that.\n\nFeatured image via Joe Mahoney / Getty Images",

In fact, his supporters made excuses for Trump in order to justify his actions.\n\nSo when Donald Trump said that he could go out and shoot someone dead in broad daylight in the middle of Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes, he was right.\n\nBecause Trump’s supporters were not fazed by any of the claims presented to them. They were even okay with him lying on his returns by listing his occupation as a farmer.\n\nSeriously.\n\nHere’s the video via YouTube.\n\nTrump’s supporters are truly deplorable people who just want to watch the world burn.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what he says or what he does or how much he embarrasses America, Donald Trump’s supporter will vote for him no matter what.\n\nSo the question is will the rest of us sit home on Election Day and let the lunatics win? Or will we get our asses off the couch and make sure Donald Trump never sets a single toe inside the White House?\n\nBecause if his supporters don’t mind him doing all of these despicable things, that means Trump could basically do whatever he wants in office without political consequences and that would be disastrous for the nation.\n\nFeatured image via screen capture",

    "content": "In an interview with a Toledo, Ohio news station, Donald Trump accidentally admitted that his “big” 20-second announcement that Barack Obama was born in the United States, “period,” was just a ruse. Speaking to ABC6/FOX28, Trump seems to have again picked up the birther ball in a “wink and nod” fashion.\n\n“This announcement earlier this week with you saying that you believe President Obama was in fact born in the United States, after all the years where you’ve expressed some doubt, what changed?” interviewer Ben Garbarek asked, prompting Trump to explain that he caved because he didn’t want to talk about it anymore — no other reason:\n\n“Well I just wanted to get on with, I wanted to get on with the campaign. A lot of people were asking me questions. We want to talk about jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about ISIS and get rid of ISIS. We want to talk about bringing jobs back to this area because you’ve been decimated so we just wanted to get back on the subject of jobs, military, taking care of our vets, etc.”\n\nYes, being able to “get on” with his campaign without being bothered by inconvenient questions about the five years he spent attempting to delegitimize the President by demanding his birth certificate, college transcripts and applications, and other documents he was sure would prove that Barry Soetoro (as the President is known in birther circles) is a Kenyan-born conman who managed to install himself as President through what we can only assume is…magic.\n\nSadly, this accidental admission that his views on the President’s birthplace and eligibility for office had not changed one iota is perhaps the most honest thing Trump has said lately, with much of his attention being focused on defending the Trump Foundation’s misuse of charitable funds to pay The Donald’s personal legal fees, attacking African-American communities, and practically publicly masturbating over the recent attacks in New York and New Jersey.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\nFeatured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Win McNamee)",

    "headline": "Trump Supporters Offer Outrageous Conspiracy Theories To Daily Show Reporter (VIDEO) – IFyouOnlyNews",
    "content": "If there is one thing you can say about Trump supporters, it is that they are sure about what they don’t know. And what they don’t know can fill volumes, as evidenced by the latest conversation with some of them, shared on the September 20 episode of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show.\n\nYou can’t blame these people for some of the conspiracy theories they believe — many of those theories started in right-wing media, like Fox News. But when asked, many Trump voters were willing to offer up their own ideas about conspiracies that go far and beyond what even Sean Hannity would probably touch.\n\nReporter Jordan Klepper visited Trump rallies to talk to the attendees and what they told him will make you laugh at first –then it just might make you cry. Trump famously said that he loves the “poorly educated” and Klepper found them in abundance as they waited to hear from their god-emperor.\n\nThe first couple of people Klepper talks to were interested in rumors about Hillary’s health. One man tells him that he thinks she has AIDS, which she got from Bill. And where did Bill get it? “From messing with that Magic Johnson,” the man replies. We assume he meant the former NBA star and not the ex-president’s, er, “johnson.”\n\nIt doesn’t take Klepper long to find people who appear to be totally divorced from reality. Like the man who believes Clinton has a body double, and when shown two identical photos of the candidate by Klepper, he quickly and confidently picks out the one he thinks is the “double.”\n\nThen there’s the guy who says President Obama reveals he is a Muslim by the way he wears his jewelry. He is referring to a long debunked story that claimed that the president stopped wearing his watch and wedding ring in observance of Ramadan. But there’s no restriction prohibiting Muslims from wearing jewelry during the holy month, except in this man’s mind. So the president appearing sans watch and wedding ring proves absolutely nothing.\n\nBut the winner is the guy who claimed that Hillary has AIDS, for his demand to know why President Obama wasn’t in the Oval Office when the World Trade Center was attacked on September 11, 2001.\n\nThese people will be voting on November 8. Will you be?\n\nHere’s the video, via Comedy Central:",

    "headline": "Trump Loses Support Of Police Union After Saying Tulsa Shooting Cop ‘Choked’ (VIDEO)",
    "content": "While giving a speech at a church rally in Cleveland, Donald Trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement – and it’s gotten him in trouble with America’s largest police union.\n\nIn speaking to the rally goers in Cleveland, Trump strayed from his normal, pro-cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about Betty Shelby, the Tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man. Clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed, Trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of African American pastors, in which he suggested that Shelby had ‘choked’:\n\n“Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can’t be doing what they’re doing, okay? They can’t be doing what they’re doing. I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you’re supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man.”\n\nTrump made these comments just five days after the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which has 330,000 members, endorsed him. But after hearing Trump criticize the Tulsa police officer, FOP executive director Jim Pasco is livid and thinks Trump’s comments were inappropriate. Pasco said that Trump “must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.”\n\nNow, no one should be proud or relieved that Trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims – he’s been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment, and is notorious for flip-flopping almost instantly. This speech was easy for Trump to say in front of black pastors – I doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience. Trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote, which may very well determine this election. Trump will say whatever he needs to win – but this time, he lost a major support group.\n\nHere’s the clip that got Trump in trouble with the police union:\n\nFeatured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images",

    "content": "Fox News host Sean Hannity desperately tried to smear Terence Crutcher on Wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local Tulsa news anchor.\n\nCrutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer Betty Shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. The murder was caught on camera.\n\nClearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them.\n\nBut Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest.\n\n“I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,” Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts.\n\n“Well I’ll tell you I looked up his history and I’m not seeing a lot of criminal history,” Mills replied. “We have something called the OSCN – the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There’s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I’ve been able to uncover.”\n\nBut Hannity didn’t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest.\n\nMills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants.\n\nHannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants.\n\n“I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven’t uncovered any myself,” Mills said. “There has been some misinformation floated.”\n\nA disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a “source” within the department and said that “it’s a matter of time of when they’re gonna release this information.”\n\nHere’s the audio via Media Matters:\n\nOnce again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn’t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. Period.\n\nFeatured Image: Screenshot",

    "headline": "Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania",
    "content": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.\n\nFirst proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.\n\nIn other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.\n\nAs Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.\n\n“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”\n\nAs we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.\n\n“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”\n\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”\n\nIn response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\n\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",

    "headline": "Hillary Clinton’s New Tax Plan Will Make Trump’s Kids FURIOUS",
    "content": "Since the Reagan administration, Americans have been sold a bill of goods that tells us that inherited money is more valuable than earned money. Republicans would like all inherited money to be completely sheltered from any taxation, while for the most part, Democrats disagree. The compromise has been that only estates valued at a whopping $5.45 million or more ($10.9 million for married couples) are taxed. Anything below that is completely tax free.\n\nNow, Hillary Clinton, after prodding from Bernie Sanders and his followers, has revised her estate tax plan and trust me when I say Donald Trump’s children won’t be happy.\n\nPreviously, Clinton said she would restore the tax on dead rich folks to its 2009 levels, pushing up the rate from 40 percent to 45 percent, and making it kick in for estates worth at least $3.5 million (today, it only hits those valued at $5.45 million or more). But, no longer. Instead, she’s borrowed a page from her formal primary rival, and now proposes turning the levy into a progressive tax—meaning it will take a bigger bite out of wealthier estates—with a top rate of 65 percent. The last time the estate tax hit that level was in 1982, though back then it also kicked in on smaller inheritances. Beyond all that, Clinton has said she would largely do away with the step-up in basis at death, a rule that allows lucky heirs to avoid paying capital gains taxes that, say, their parents or uncle or other rich benefactor would have owed had they sold their stock before passing away. In the end, the committee expects these measures to raise about $225 billion over ten years. Source: Slate\n\nAs it stands, the estate tax system is a joke. In 2012, a staggering $1.2 trillion was passed down as an inheritance. Of that, less than 1 percent was taxed. As for the Republican argument that estate taxes will hurt small businesses, in 2013, only 20 small businesses and family farm estates, in the entire country, had to pay estate taxes.\n\nThe other common Republican argument is that estate taxes are “double taxation” (as if every other dollar in the American economy hasn’t been taxed multiple times), but the reality is that most of what comprises large estates comes from capital gains, which are also unlikely to have every been taxed.\n\nOf course, even if Clinton is elected, she’ll have a tough time passing this, at least as long as Paul Ryan is in charge of the House. He wants Trump’s kids to pay zero in estate taxes. Of course, for all we know, Trump himself pays zero in taxes.\n\nFeatured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images.",

    "headline": "Trump Blames Charlotte Rioting On Drug Use, Without Any Proof",
    "content": "Another day, another racist dog whistle echoed by Donald Trump. While the urban unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina continues, Trump – in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential – blamed the rioting on drug use, without citing any facts to back up his claim.\n\nThe comment, made in a speech in Pittsburgh, was off-script:\n\n“If you’re not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you’re watching on television.”\n\nSomehow, everyone but Donald Trump is unaware of the “factors” contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs, but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement.\n\nWhat Donald Trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist, stereotype that plagues this country: blacks are on drugs, and it makes them violent.\n\nThe facts are out there: white people do more drugs, and serve less time. This notion that because black Americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is, yes, racist. It reaffirms people’s ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels.\n\nRecent findings in the American Journal of Public Health, the abuse and dependency on “hard drugs” are “less common among delinquent African American youth than those who are non-Hispanic white.” White people, in general, are also more likely to deal drugs than black people. So the people selling drugs to our kids, parents, and members of the community are more likely to be white than black, but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of America’s drug problem.\n\nAnd Donald Trump’s claim, no matter how minuscule it may be, just makes the problem worse.\n\nInstead of accusing black Americans of being drug-induced degenerates, maybe Trump should travel up to New Hampshire and Maine, where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year, and nothing is being done to combat it.\n\nDonald Trump says the unrest in Charlotte would not happen in a Trump administration. Would New England’s drug epidemic be stopped under his administration? Would the killing of unarmed black people – which is the only contribution to the unrest – stop in his administration? Would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in people’s minds, regardless of what the facts are?\n\nTrump’s going to get a huge wake up call with black voters in November if he keeps this up.\n\nFeatured image via Sarah D.

    "content": "Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.\n\nJournalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters\n\nNow, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.\n\nCrime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:\n\nFear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic\n\nSure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.\n\nFeatured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images.",

    "content": "There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:\n\nWhile on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.\n\nAfter Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:\n\nFor the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.\n\nUnfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.\n\nHopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.\n\nIf there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

    "content": "This election will ask us to choose one of the following: an overqualified, dignified woman, or a fascist, xenophobic billionaire. The woman, Hillary Clinton, has dedicated her life to fighting for the rights and dignities of all, while the man, Donald Trump, has fought only for himself and his pockets.\n\nOne group that tends to vote Democrat – but has been leaning a little more towards the right recently – are Jewish people. In 2008, 78 percent of Jewish Americans voted for President Obama, as did 74 percent in 2012.\n\nThis year is different. Instead of facing off against John McCain or Mitt Romney, the Democrats are facing off against the definition of fascism and xenophobia. And they have a message to their grandchildren: vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhy? Because they’ve seen this before.\n\nIn a video titled “A Message From Grandma & Grandpa: We’ve Seen This Before,” a group of elderly Jewish Americans plead with their younger generations to get out and vote, and warns against the type of man Donald Trump is. They “enlisted some powerful allies in the effort to defeat Donald Trump: grandparents.” And they aren’t holding back:\n\n“This is probably one of the most important elections, because there is so much is at stake.”\n\nOf course, their experiences with Germany take front and center:\n\n“We have seen this before. We saw it in Germany, and don’t want to see it again.”\n\nTheir hatred for Trump is not hidden, and for good reason:\n\n“Trump is more than a tyrant. He’s an obnoxious lying individual and I haven’t any respect for him. I have tremendous fears for the country and and for you, my grandchildren.”\n\nAdding some lighthearted (but important) humor, one grandparent tells their grandkids:\n\n“If you vote the future is yours. If you don’t vote for Hillary, and that crazy man Trump is elected, I’ll haunt you when I die.”\n\nAnother promises to be a major spoiler:\n\n“I’ll spoil every episode of ‘Game of Thrones. When you’re having a dinner party, I’ll come down and say something racist, but if you’re voting for Trump, you probably don’t care.”\n\nThe powerful video, sponsored by Bend the Arc Jewish Action, was released to warn future generations not to forget their history, and to listen to the wisdom of their elders, especially ones that know oppression when they see it:\n\n“We, as Jews, recognize that [Trump’s] candidacy has echoed times when the Jewish community experienced the dangers of fascism, anti-immigration and persecution against religious minorities. We’ve seen this before and we wanted to make sure that as Jews we were speaking out boldly and loudly and making sure it was known the Jewish community rejects Trump for the platform of hatred and bigotry that he has unleashed.”\n\nWatch the powerful ad here:\n\nFeatured image from the video",

    "headline": "Trump Literally Just Said He’d Take Guns Away From Anyone Without Due Process",
    "content": "In discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates, Donald Trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in Chicago, and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective, he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process. Of course, he thinks that the police would only take guns away from criminals, and that the Constitution is different for criminals, but everyone has a constitutional right to due process. Doesn’t matter to Trump, though:\n\n“We have to take guns away…from bad people that shouldn’t have them.”\n\nThose were Trump’s words in the debate, where he defended stop-and-frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise, and has also been deemed ineffective. How the NRA can possibly support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us. That’s especially true given the fact that this isn’t the first time Trump has said this:\n\n“[Police officers are] proactive, and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun, they will see the person and they’ll look and they’ll take the gun away. They’ll stop, they’ll frisk and they’ll take the gun away, and they won’t have anything to shoot with.”\n\nThe 2nd Amendment cannot exist without due process. The NRA is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law-abiding citizens. Literally.\n\nFeatured image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",

    "content": "It’s no secret that Bill Maher, comedian extraordinaire and host of HBO’s Real Time, is no fan of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. So, of course he couldn’t resist live tweeting the entire first general election presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The whole thing was one brilliant insult against Trump after another. Here are a few of the better tweets:\n\nGOP won expectations game when it nominated an orangutan. As long as he doesn't fling his poop, \"Surprisingly dignified Trump last night\" — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nWant to see Hillary come out and say \"The Russians just handed me your tax returns\" just to see if Trump bolts — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump adjusting his Spanx right now, and one final pass with the can of Final Net… — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump proud of himself that he called her \"Secretary Clinton\" – as opposed to what, Bitchula? — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump. Wearing a tie made in China, just sayin' — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nOK,I hope she's playing rope-a-dope, and I do mean dope, because I'm getting tired of this vile nincompoop bullying and lieing and its early — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump: \"Being in Iraq was a disaster, but we shld take the oil\"WE WLD HAVE TO BE BACK IN IRAQ TO TAKE THE OIL! They won't give it to a drone — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nbtw, you know a charge agst Trump is 100% provably true when he interrupts with \"Wrong!\" #debates — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nAnd, of course, for his closers, Maher had to do what he’s been doing on his show ever since it became clear who the nominees would be, and hit those who refuse to vote for Hillary:\n\nHowever this comes out, I have so little respect for the electorate just that its this close. She's right, she shld be 50 points ahead. — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nBut he definitely saved his best line for last, as he called Trump his favorite phrase:\n\nNegative ads in a political race are \"not nice?\" There's no crying in politics, you #WhinyLittleBitch! — Bill Maher (@billmaher) September 27, 2016\n\nLet’s face it, no matter how Trump’s surrogates try to spin this — and they are already out in force doing their damndest — he lost this thing tonight, badly. He made an absolute fool of himself. There’s just no way around it. Of course, his uneducated core supporters will still vote for him, but there’s no way this one got the undecided voters into Trump’s corner. The one thing tonight did do, though, is give us plenty of entertainment.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images",

    "headline": "Enough Excuses: Five Ways Hillary Won The Debate Hands Down",
    "content": "Last night America finally got to see Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton together in the same room. And just as expected, there was some much pent up sparring. Once the evening had concluded, it was evident who won that debate, no questions asked: Hillary Clinton.\n\nNo one should be surprised. While the media has been speculating that viewers would once again see a “Trump pivot,” the facts remain the same — what we saw on the debate stage was the same Trump we saw during the Republican primaries — a brash, condescending, loudmouthed bully who has no plans, only talking points.\n\nAll the pundits know it. The polls know it. The people know it. Hillary Clinton won because she was prepared, she was eloquent, and she kept her cool. But not surprisingly, Trump and his band of surrogates didn’t get the memo. They think they won. Because why not?\n\nTrump (and his people) say Lester Holt was unfair. They say the microphone was tampered with. They say Hillary Clinton was “too prepared” so it was an unfair advantage. They say the media was too biased.\n\nExcuse after excuse, Trump refuses to take responsibility for his actions. he was unprepared, he was disrespectful, he couldn’t elaborate, and he got personal.\n\nBut enough about Trump and his candy-ass excuses. Let’s talk about why Hillary Clinton was clearly the winner.\n\nShe was prepared\n\nLook no further than her best zinger of the night: “I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that’s a good thing.” It’s been reported that Clinton immersed herself with the issues of our times, poring over research, conducting rehearsals, and doing her homework. Trump, on the other hand, was taking a casual, passive approach to the debates, and it showed. He couldn’t elaborate, he didn’t show decorum, and he didn’t know how to respond to Clinton’s assertions — except with lies.\n\nShe was tough, yet composed\n\nThe bar was set pretty low due to Trump. Clinton knew she had to somewhat get on his level, but stay true to who she really is. This debate ended up being something special. She was up against a loud, bombastic, unpredictable bully who says whatever he pleases. Luckily for her, she didn’t take any of his lies personally. She fact checked him when Holt wouldn’t. She smiled politely as he sunk into the abyss with his never ending rambles. She wasn’t “too loud” as the pundits like to call it, but she was forceful when need be. And, even though it’s a stupid assessment (but somehow matters), she smiled.\n\nShe respected Holt and upheld decorum\n\nOne of the reasons people hate debates is because they find that the moderators don’t do their jobs. They allow the candidates to walk all over them, they go over their allotted time, they interrupt each other. It gets annoying. Luckily, Trump was in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton. She listened to Holt when he told her that her time was up, and rarely interrupted Holt to attack Trump. While Trump interrupted Clinton 51 times, she interrupted Trump only 17 times. At the end, Clinton shook Holt’s hand, and Trump did not.\n\nShe was fundamentally honest\n\nWhile Trump’s famous “Crooked Hillary” was front and center on Snapchat, the facts paint a different story. NPR, the non-partisan gold standard of what’s left of journalism, did an in-depth fact check analysis and showed that, surprise, Trump lied way more than Clinton, while Clinton’s claims were mostly upheld as true.\n\nShe had the better plan\n\nWhile Donald Trump painted America as third world, crime-riddled hellhole, Clinton offered us a hopeful, inspiring message of bringing back jobs, fixing broken race relations, and investigating in future generations. Her plan would create 10 million jobs — his would cut 3.5 million. She wants to curb gun violence against black youth by holding them and communities (yes, that includes police officers) accountable. Trump wants to implement the unconstitutional and ineffective Stop and Frisk. Surprisingly, the agreed on several issues, such as the No-Fly gun ban, opposition to the TPP, and a need to bring jobs back from overseas. But simply put, her way, not “Trumped up trickle down,” will get us there.\n\nThis is why Clinton won. She was the stronger candidate, and she shined while everyone was hoping it would be the other way around. Trump devolved into his classic self as she increasingly got under his skin.\n\nNo, it wasn’t Holt’s fault. No, it wasn’t the microphone’s fault. No, it wasn’t Hillary’s fault. It was Trump’s fault, plain and simple. Maybe he’ll take preparation a little more seriously for next time. Or maybe not. it is Trump, after all.\n\nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",

    "content": "Donald Trump is most criticized for his temperament to the point of many saying it disqualifies him from the office of president. Lets look at Trumps objectionable temperament and then see what it has to do with being president. Mark Mellman made these observations “…a crucial contrast on character is frankly much more powerful than when you make a contrast on policy.” This is why we are looking at character in the first place, so we do not look at failed policies. Dr. Frank said, “Most of my colleagues feel that he’s not crazy, and if he is crazy, he’s crazy like a fox,”.\n\nDan P. Adams,who analyzes character traits concluded not surprisingly, that Donald Trump has “sky-high extroversion combined with off-the-chart low agreeableness (the extent to which a person appears to be caring, loving, affectionate, polite, and kind). Anger may be the operative emotion behind Trump’s high extroversion as well as his low agreeableness. Anger can fuel malice, but it can also motivate social dominance, stoking a desire to win the adoration of others. Trump may be a more flexible and pragmatic decision maker, more like Bill Clinton than Bush. Decision makers who, like Nixon, who are dispositionally low on agreeableness might hold certain advantages when it comes to balancing competing interests or bargaining with adversaries.”\n\nMany other presidents ranked high in these traits. Among them was Lyndon Johnson who scored the highest, followed closely by Teddy Roosevelt, Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton. Trump’s personality type is classified as a Promoter. Other non-presidents who fit this category are Ernest Hemingway, Eva Peron, Winston Churchill, Grace Slick, Madonna, George S. Patton, and Steve Jobs. “They are Bold and daring at heart, and ever-optimistic that things will go their way. Promoters will take tremendous risks to get what they want, and seem exhilarated by walking close to the edge of disaster. Because of this, they make the very best trouble-spot administrators and negotiators, and they can be outstanding entrepreneurs, able to swing deals and kick-start enterprises in a way no other type can.” says Dan Adams,\n\nTrending: Obama: The Most Corrupt and America-Hating President in U.S. History\n\nTake Andrew Jackson for example. His campaign centered on Jackson’s image as a man of the people battling aristocracy and corruption. Strong-willed and sharp-tempered, a fierce patriot and rabid partisan, Jackson was always controversial. He personalized disputes and demonized opponents. Yet behind Jackson’s towering rages often lay shrewd calculation of their political effects. Jackson’s quick temper was notorious. His audacity on behalf of the people earned him enemies who slandered him. Jackson was often in control of his rage, and used it (and his fearsome reputation) as a tool to get what he wanted in his public and private affairs. His opponents were terrified of his temper: Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. He believed that the president is not just an executive but also a representative of all the people. He entered office determined to end government corruption and the nation’s financial difficulties caused, he thought, by the upper-class elite in government, business, and finance.(Taken from a variety of historical sources).\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?

    "content": "“Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people.” —Dan Stein, President of FAIR\n\n\n\nIn a report released by the Federation of American Immigration Reform (FAIR), they have charged that the Obama administration “grossly misrepresented – by almost tenfold” the number of crimes that were committed by illegal, criminal aliens who were released from custody in fiscal year 2014.\n\nNow, if the term “illegal, criminal aliens” sounds like overkill, understand that the term illegal does refer to aliens who are in the united States illegally, which makes them criminals. However, applying the term criminal relates to the fact that they committed a crime while here illegals and were incarcerated, but not deported.\n\n“In response to an inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee in July 2015, ICE reported that the 30,558 criminal aliens it released, instead of deported, in FY 2014 were convicted of an additional 1,423 offenses,” read FAIR’s press release. “However, the ICE records that were requested by The Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) on FAIR’s behalf show that the actual number of subsequent convictions racked up by the criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 was actually 13,288. It is important to note that not all criminal charges result in convictions. Thus, the number of offenses committed by criminal aliens ICE turned loose is likely significantly greater.”\n\n“The criminal aliens responsible for these 13,288 convictions were not considered sufficiently dangerous to be deported under ICE’s self-declared ‘priorities’ for removal,” the press release added. “The list of convictions for offenses committed by criminals ICE did not deem worthy of deportation in FY 2014 includes: homicide, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, drunk driving, and other offenses. Yet despite the clear knowledge that its policies resulted in thousands of avoidable crimes, ICE doubled down in FY 2015—releasing nearly 20,000 additional deportable criminals.”\n\n“In recent years, the number of criminal aliens deported has plummeted, despite ample funds to remove many more. As a result of Obama administration policies that place protection of illegal aliens—including criminals—over the safety of the American public, thousands of people have been needlessly victimized,” charged Dan Stein, president of FAIR.\n\n“Rather than end dangerous politically-driven policies that have put a total of 85,000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people,” added Stein. “Moreover, despite knowing the true extent of the criminal activities committed by the aliens they were releasing, DHS scrapped the Secure Communities program designed to allow ICE to take custody of criminal aliens who are being held by local police.”\n\n“Congress has to act. It is being lied to by an administration that is misrepresenting the facts and a president that refuses to enforce immigration laws in favor of manipulating policy for political gain,” Stein concluded.\n\nIn March of 2015 Freedom of Information Act Documents exposed the fact that 165,900 convicted criminal illegals were released on the streets of the US by Homeland Security. They were not deported. In fact, so-called “sanctuary cities” released 9,000 criminal illegals in 9 months during 2015 who were supposed to be deported, but never were.\n\nIn 2014, it was also reported the administration released 75% of illegals rather than deport them.\n\nIt appears to me that DHS needs to be renamed the Department of Homeland IN-Security. What do you think?\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "Why do Homosexuals Need to be Tested for HIV and AIDS, Since Their Behavior is Normal and Healthy?",
    "content": "I was watching a local news show about a business called “Out of the Closet.” They are a series of thrift stores to benefit AIDS Healthcare Foundation. Not only can you purchase second-hand and consignment merchandise, but you can get free HIV and STD tests.\n\nI found this rather curious. Why would a pro-homosexual advocacy business like “Out of the Closet” be offering HIV and STD tests? What is it about the sexual practices of homosexuals that they would need to be tested for sexual diseases?\n\nI don’t need to be tested for HIV and STDs. The only people who would need to be tested are those who engaged in behaviors that lead to HIV and STDs. If two people are married and only engage in sex with one another, neither of them would ever get HIV or an STD.\n\nThe following is reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\n“Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men, with recent increases in syphilis being documented across the country. In 2012, men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 75% of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States. MSM often are diagnosed with other STDs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.”\n\nOne would think the AIDS scare of the 1980s would have been an empirical indicator that same-sex relationships, as well as shared drug needles, are destructive behaviors.\n\nWe were told that anyone could get AIDS. There’s a commercial running today that makes this claim. If this is true, then all stores should be offering tests. But they don’t because it would be a massive insult to the vast majority of people who do not engage in same-sex sexual activity.\n\nAnother empirical indicator that same-sex relationships are abnormal is that there is no chance of procreation. Homosexuals have to be artificially inseminated or adopt.\n\nWhen morality, science, and common sense conflict with liberal ideology, you can always count on governments to use force in order to make people comply.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "content": "They don’t call CNN the Clinton News Network for nothing. They’re there to defend the presidential candidate at all costs and not let any inconvenient facts get in the way.\n\nCNN host Chris Cuomo – the New York Governor’s little brother – got into a tense exchange with one of Donald Trump’s advisers Boris Epshteyn.\n\nCuomo argued that Trump should come clean with the birther issue, just as Hillary Clinton owned up to her private server issue. “With Hillary Clinton, she had to own the server thing,” Cuomo said. “It was wrong. We heard from all the people around her that it was wrong, she shouldn’t have done it, it was poorly thought out. It wasn’t enough. Why?”\n\nEpshteyn responded that they’re not the same thing. “And Hillary Clinton — there’s no equivalency. Hillary Clinton did something illegal. She broke the law.” They continued:\n\nChris Cuomo: She did not do anything illegal.\n\nBoris Epshteyn: Yes, she did.\n\nCuomo: James Comey’s a liar, too?\n\nEpshteyn: He said she shouldn’t be prosecuted. He did say she acted carelessly, and as a lawyer, if you look at all the particulars of bringing that case, there was a case to bring. And he said so, too.\n\nCuomo: No, he didn’t. He said there’s no case that could be brought, there’s nothing prosecutable about it. He just said it in his report. He said it wasn’t a close call.\n\nNever mind the fact that even the FBI Director himself stated that it is a “felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.”\n\nIsn’t that exactly what Hillary Clinton did? Comey even said that she was “extremely careless” – in other words, grossly negligent – in her handling of classified information. And everyone knows that she had some 13 different mobile devices in addition to her private home server, which had on it classified information.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "EXCLUSIVE: This is What $216 Million Bought These Clinton Foundation Donors",
    "content": "A total of 205 Clinton Foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $216 million since 2009, were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation’s capital: prestigious seats at one or more White House State Dinners, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation.\n\nAt least 15 of the Clinton Foundation’s corporate donors — representing $47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners.\n\nSignificantly, the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all, but were ensconced in the Department State’s Office of Protocol. The protocol office, chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists.\n\nDespite the Democratic presidential nominee’s departure from the Department of State in 2013, all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout Obama’s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill Clinton’s White House or in Hillary’s Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns.\n\nCritics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton’s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “walked away” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office.\n\nAfter Cheng left the Department of State, he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation. He is now Hillary’s national fundraiser, leading her presidential bid to raise $2 billion. As a result, The Daily Beast once called him, “Hillary Clinton’s $2 billion money man.”\n\nIf Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation, he may have violated a special “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008. The MOU warned of avoiding “potential or actual conflict of interest.”\n\nCheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208, a federal statute that “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests,” including those of a prospective employer or a family member.\n\n“How much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol, migrated over to the Clinton Foundation,” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation.\n\n“We don’t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis Cheng’s personal cell phone, or on a contact list that might have been emailed.” he said in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nNeither the foundation nor Hillary’s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng.\n\nBill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action, asserting, “to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation.”\n\nYet, official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington, D.C., and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce.\n\nGuests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors, but they also offer privileged access to the president, top White House staff and many cabinet members.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova, who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington, D.C., told TheDCNF the White House dinners weren’t only benefits, but amounted to the “selling of access.”\n\n“The obvious connection between donations and access to big, White House state dinners is very important,” he said in an interview with TheDCNF. “It was clearly a reward to donors, something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation,” he stated. DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case.\n\n“We are looking into Cheng’s relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class,” former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF. Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust (FACT).\n\n“Cheng is the person in the middle of this situation. He had substantial input as to who was invited, who got seated where,” he said.\n\n“I would say Cheng’s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing,” Whitaker added.\n\n“It’s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation, not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department, but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House,” he told TheDCNF.\n\nFACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act. The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015, but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election.\n\n“They have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now they’re telling us that we probably won’t get it until mid-to-late November,” Whitaker said. He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009.\n\nThe protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans. When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office, his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who, at age 32, served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president.\n\nAfter Cheng left in 2011, his replacement was Natalie Jones, who was Hillary’s Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid. Jones was joined by Mark Walsh, Hillary’s LGBT “outreach director” from her 2008 campaign.\n\nPeter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office. He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill Clinton’s White House.\n\nOne of the most revealing illustration of Cheng’s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges.\n\nIn a March 8, 2012 email from Marshall to Jones, Cheng and Hillary’s deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin, the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14, 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\n“Invited to state dinner,” Marshall informed the group.\n\nTwo of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who gave between $100,000 to $250,000, and Fred Eychaner, who committed $25 million to the foundation.\n\n“Nice,” replies Abedin.\n\nAlthough the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and Clinton’s official business, Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign nationals.\n\nIn a June 11, 2012 email, he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner. “Attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night’s Clinton Foundation dinner,” he wrote Abedin.\n\nAmong those attending was Recep Ozkan, a Turkish national who donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nOzkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen, a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan.\n\nErdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen, according to Tuesday reports.\n\nAlso attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma, who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office.\n\nThe email was obtained by Citizens United, a conservative group, under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nOne of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta, a long-time personal friend of Bill’s who was convicted of insider trading. He served two years in a federal penitentiary.\n\nGupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job. Without any experience, he paid her a six figure salary. Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009.\n\nOrtel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during Bill’s first term at the White House. At the time, Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors.\n\n“To see the pattern, you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House, the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom, to sell seats on Air Force One,” Ortel told TheDCNF. “So this was an old game.”\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation, told TheDCNF, “This is further evidence of the Clinton’s ‘Pay to Play’ mentality. The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government’s highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check.”\n\n“The quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything,” Blackburn charged.\n\nIn addition to the donations paid outright to the Clinton Foundation, a number of corporate donors also paid Bill and Hillary high six-figure speaking fees.\n\nLloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs’ chairman and CEO, attended one of the hottest state dinners — a January 19, 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao.\n\nHis company donated $1 to $5 million to the foundation, and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website.\n\nBut that wasn’t the only contributions to Bill and Hillary. The company also gave the couple $2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues.\n\nBrian Moynihan, Bank of America’s CEO and chairman, attended the May 19, 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon, Mexico’s former president.\n\nThe Bank of America Foundation donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation, and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $100,000 to $250,000.\n\nBut Bank of America also paid more than $1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were: Honeywell, GE, Dreamworks, PepsiCo, Morgan Stanley, Coca Cola, Dow, Boeing, Intel, UPS, Comcast, IBM and the Blackstone Group. Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners.\n\nJ.T. Mastranadi, political director of the Citizens United, said his organization’s conclusion was, “regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance.”\n\nTheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and Hillary’s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation. Neither responded.\n\nTo see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners, click here.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "content": "In 2016, a scathing “tell-all” book, “Hillary—The Other Woman” written by the author, Dolly Kyle, exposed the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton was\n\nThe book focuses on Hillary’s war on anyone who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House and shines a light on one of America’s most skilled opportunists.\n\nDolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.\n\nIn her book, she wrote of one occasion when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas statehouse.\n\nReluctant hostess Hillary had enough.\n\n‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.\n\nWhen Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies.’\n\nShe was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.\n\nHillary didn’t belong in Arkansas, but here she was’.\n\nIn the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state, and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.\n\nHe was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House. Via: Daily Mail\n\nHillary’s not the only female, Democrat presidential hopeful to think it’s okay to refer to mentally disabled people as “retards.”\n\nSeptember 9, 2019: During a recent town hall meeting in New Hampshire, for Democrat 2020 primary presidential candidate, Senator Kamala Harris, one of her supporters stood up and asked Harris what she was going to do to stop President Trump over the next year? “What in the next one year to diminish the mentally retarded action of this guy?” he asked. While the crowd of Democrats applauded his question, Senator Harris laughed, while congratulating him on his choice of words, “Well said!” the Senator told her supporter, and for good measure, she repeated herself, “Well said!”\n\nI once said “mentally retarded” on Twitter and got banned. How come @KamalaHarris is allowed to endorse that kind of language? “Well said”. pic.twitter.com/tTJyQex7I8 — Raheem Kassam (@RaheemKassam) September 7, 2019\n\nAfter the video of Harris went viral on social media, the Democrat who has a history of retracting her statements after realizing she angered or insulted people in her party, did what she does best, she tried to cover her tracks.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris tweeted (see below) that she “didn’t hear the words”:\n\n“When my staff played the video from my town hall yesterday, it was upsetting. I didn’t hear the words the man used in that moment, but if I had I would’ve stopped and corrected him. I’m sorry. That word and others like it aren’t acceptable. Ever.”\n\nHave Americans had enough of Democrats insulting them and their intelligence? It very clear to anyone watching the video that Harris heard exactly what the man said, otherwise, why would she have responded with, “Well said!”?\n\nShould prominent Democrat leaders be referring to people with mental disabilities as “retards” or “retarded”? Didn’t Democrats write the book of politically acceptable terms?",

Hillary put an end to it.\n\nWhen it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?\n\nThere was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.\n\nSo they left early.\n\nThe camera followed them out of the room, scurrying like the rats they are.\n\nBUSTED!",

    "content": "Scene number one – Cairo, Egypt:\n\nI am packing my luggage. At last, I am fulfilling my dream. I am ready for a long journey to a developed country that respects science and scientists. I am ready to join the developed world.\n\nScene number two – New York, America:\n\nI feel shaky. I am stepping on the American land for the first time. I am joyful. I’m full of euphoria, and I am worried. It’s a new life. I’m looking for a happy future, but am still scared. What if all of this is just a dream and is not really happening?\n\nScene number three – Louisville, Kentucky:\n\nI am not dreaming – it’s really happening. I am in a class in America for the first time. I pinched myself to make sure I’m awake.\n\nScene number four – a couple of weeks since my arrival:\n\nI’m having an awful nightmare. I’m walking out of the classroom to find all of the faculty, the staff, and the students standing in a line. At the front of the line, there is a small TV in the Secretary’s office. A major terrorist attack has occurred. I wish it’s not true, and that it’s just a bad dream. I am hoping to wake up. However, It was true, I was awake, it was really happening.\n\nScene number five – I take my spot in the line waiting and my heart is racing:\n\nWhat if they were Muslims? Please God, don’t let them be Muslims. The news came, the truth was hard. They were Muslims and worse, the leader is Egyptian.\n\nI am speechless. I covered my face with my hands from the shame and I tried to walk away. An American professor tapped on my back with sympathy. An older American student whispered in my ear: “Take care of yourself. Some people might hurt you in blind retaliation.” I didn’t have a car then, and an American girl who I hardly knew offered to drive me home.\n\nI came here to study and work in a developed country. Later, I realized that the biggest gain is living among civilized people.\n\nScene number six – many weeks later, I am in the airport:\n\nI am being harassed in the airports by the security every time I try to fly. Every time, I am picked randomly for a body search. This time, after every kind of search was performed on me and I was about to step in the airplane with my carry-on bag, a security person told me: ”Sir, you can’t have this bag with you on the airplane.” I screamed: ”I have the right to have a carry-on item!” He repeated in a begging tone: “Please sir, you can’t have this bag with you.”\n\nThe worries and the fear in his eyes quelled my anger. I gave him the bag. I murmured: “What is some harassment? It’s a very small sacrifice compared to what was paid by those who lost their lives defending this country.”\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "U.S. Spends $5 TRILLION on War on Terror…Terrorism Increases by 6,500%",
    "content": "The government’s answer to every failed program or ineffective federal department is to dump more taxpayer money in it.\n\nEver since government education has become the norm, kids are dumb and dumber. But big government advocates claim that the problem is that they just don’t have enough money. So, they throw more money at it, and the problems only get bigger. Ever since the War on Drugs was declared, we’ve spent over $1.5 trillion, and drug use remains unchanged or even worse. But instead of questioning the policy or considering the Constitutionality of the issue, their answer is to throw more money at it, in hopes that they’ll finally stamp out illegal drug usage once and for all. But it only gets worse.\n\nThe same is true with the “War on Terror.” The U.S. government dumped $5 trillion into it, terrorism has increased by leaps and bounds. But instead of reevaluating our foreign policy – especially pertaining to the Middle East – the politicians’ answer is to expand our foreign policy, and of course, throw more money at it. And terrorism continues to grow. From Zero Hedge:\n\nAccording to a report released by Dr. Neta Crawford, professor of political science at Brown University, spending by the United States Departments of Defense, State, Homeland Security, and Veteran Affairs since 9/11 is now close to $5 trillion USD. Before we have the chance to ask how a country that has racked up over $19.3 trillion USD in debt can spend $5 trillion USD on war, the focus of this article is to ask: What has all of this spending achieved? As Reader Supported News reported at the end of last year, terrorism has increased 6,500 percent since 2002 (they probably should rename it “the war of terror”). In 2014, the outlet noted, it was reported that 74 percent of all terror-related casualties occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, or Syria. As stated by Paul Gottinger, a staff reporter for Reader Supported News, out of the aforementioned countries, “only Nigeria did not experience either U.S. air strikes or a military occupation in that year.” Omitted from that assessment is the fact that the U.S. has been meddling in Nigeria for some time now. Why wouldn’t they? Until recently, Nigeria was Africa’s largest oil producer, as well as the continent’s largest economy until last month.\n\nAnd look at this shocker from Ben Swann:\n\n“Before the 2003 U.S. invasion, do you know how many suicide attacks there were in Iraq? None. In the country’s history there had never been one. But since the 2003 invasion, there have been 1,892. “In Iraq, prior to the start of the Iraq war, there were reportedly just over 1.5 million Christians living in that country. And yet shortly after the war started, more than one million of them fled to Syria. That didn’t work out well. Today fewer than half a million Christians remain and yet are being exterminated by groups like ISIS.”\n\nThe more terrorism grows and is a threat to our national security, the more laws the U.S. government passes that not only continually erode away at our freedoms, but do nothing to protect us.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses”",
    "content": "Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.\n\nI don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "The Criminality in Government Accounting • Dale Netherton • iPatriot",
    "content": "There are severe penalties for lying in the courts and lying to Congress. With this premium on truth you would think any government operation would necessarily be truth driven. After witnessing the idiotic promises from candidates for public office you may begin to suspect that the honoring of truth is only for those who are not in government or who get caught. The problem is the issue is far more grave than most people suspect even in their most dubious moods. The issue I am talking about is in the field of government accounting.\n\nNow we all know about the $600 hammers and the waste in superfluous studies that find the obvious and spend billions to do it. But this accounting is small potatoes beside the larger issue of how the government manipulates the core index when trying to downplay the real rate of inflation. Now just a word about the insidiousness of inflation and the consequences of allowing it to creep into full blown hyper-inflation. Countries have turned from peace to war, democracies to dictatorships, semi-free to Fascist and completely collapsed because they were unable or unwilling to control inflation. Check out the demise of major powers past and present and you will find an unsound currency is the one common factor that contributed to the collapse/demise. And the soundness of the currency was always based on the government creating currency in volumes that had no backing except the promise to pay from further borrowing, taxation and currency expansion ( i.e the printing of paper money ).\n\nWith so much at stake you would think the government would want to know exactly what is the rate of inflation and how can it be kept under control. After all how could anyone be so suicidal to hide the figures that would need to be reviewed and acted upon to perpetuate a country’s government? As I spoke of in an earlier article, politicians are sacrificial both in what they seek and what they ask of their constituents. This sacrificial banner becomes a shroud for themselves when the seek to deceive and ignore what they think they are getting away with because no one is naming the issue. This is why they have earned so much distrust and disapproval.\n\nTrending: Obama: The Most Corrupt and America-Hating President in U.S. History\n\nFro a complete understanding of the hideousness of the government’s attempt to distort and hide true inflation rates I refer you to an article written by Jim Puplava at http://www.financialsense.com/stormwatch/2005/0624.html . What motivates the people on a committee to deliberately distort the way the government determines inflation rates so that the government can continue its deficit spending and ultimately bankrupting the country? It is the same motivation of the unrepentant cookie stealer. They think they can get away with it. And they can and they will if no one calls them to task and points out the dishonesty they are promoting. In today’s world of politics it would require a ground swell of voters making enough noise and demanding accurate honest figures but most voters are ignorant of the practices and gullible regarding the truly evil motives at work in the bowels of the very organization that is charged with protecting the country.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? Has Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? * Yes No Maybe not treason but should be removed from impeachment inquiry\n\nEmail *\n\nName This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Completing this poll grants you access to iPatriot updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nThe irony is the stupidity of those who think they are pulling the wool over the eyes of the populace. What they are hiding are the very facts and figures that will protect not only the country but their livelihood and their ultimate survival. This is beyond stupid and certainly falls well within the category of criminality. This in an organization that is charged with protecting the citizenry from criminals. But what security is there in the fox guarding the hen house?\n\nThis issue is not covered on the financial channels on TV to any extent. It is ignored by the press and all the talk radio pundits rarely question what is obvious to everyday Americans watching prices go through the roof. When the issue is brought up, Americans are prone to trust the government to give accurate figures and believe the inflation rate, no matter how it is computed , is real and there is no need for concern. As Ronald Reagan said, “ Trust but verify”. There is no verification to be found that the figures being spouted are true. The real figures are much higher and this means the government has less financial problems to worry about as long as they can push this scam down the populace’s throat. The adjustments to Social Security are lower because of these bogus figures, the government debt is viewed as lower because of these figures, the weak dollar is the result of the real figures the government doesn’t want to face up to and the cheap appearance of the coinage reflects the same phenomena.\n\nNow that the American public is getting excited about a presidential race it is time to ask these pretentious candidates what they know about the “core index” that reflects the rate of inflation and what are they going to do to get the government to recognize it is deceiving the American public with its bogus rate of inflation to the detriment of the entire country. There is not one candidate that has brought the issue up and there is not one who will have a satisfactory answer to why they haven’t. If you believe the press has commentators that can ask hard questions you need to take a hard look at this very pressing issue and ask yourself why this has not even been raised. The emperor of inflation is parading around naked as a jay bird and no one in the reporting business has even spotted him.\n\nNot only is the government deceiving and manipulating the American public but the free press charged with finding the truth and reporting on it ,is ignoring the very essence of our survival as a nation. There has been a concern with human cloning expressed by the U.N. and others, but the cloning from our universities has already occurred. The clones are the genetic/intellectual equivalent of their instructors who dream of a fantasy modeled by Plato’s Utopia and care not one whit about the truth nor the means of attainment. As with the Soviet experiment, what they seek is oblivion. Faking reality doesn’t change reality , it only destroys the dishonest. Facing reality requires a hard cold look not a placating syrupy soothing assurance that all is well and will turn out for the best if we’ll just be faithful , trusting and above all quiet. The terrorists on 9/11 offered such assurances to the trusting passengers as they flew into oblivion. We are passengers in the same predicament and like the passengers in Pennsylvania we need to “Roll” or perish for the ideals of the misguided, misinformed, dishonest pretending to work for the public good.\n\nTags:\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author and are not not necessarily either shared or endorsed by iPatriot.com.",

    "content": "The reason 858 were given full citizenship is because our director of the Department of Homeland Security is a treasonous radical left-wing open borders advocate who doesn’t give a damn about America’s homeland security.\n\nThink about it…Jeh Johnson is responsible for this negligence and enabling of any and all “mistakes” big and small. He is the director of the DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY yet he’s a snake who continuously looks the other way while illegals from all over the globe cross our borders. Johnson famously said he felt that illegals were already American citizens:\n\nThe nation’s top immigration officer said that the “11 million” undocumented aliens in the United States are “not going away,” are “in effect” citizens, and added that deporting the few the administration wants out is unpleasant:\n\nTHIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TREASON! SKIP TO THE 25:00 MARK FOR HIS COMMENTS ON ILLEGALS:\n\n\n\nWell, he just made 858 illegals from “hotbed” terror countries American citizens!\n\nHundreds of illegal immigrants from terrorist hotbeds who were supposed to have been deported were instead granted citizenship because Homeland Security didn’t have fingerprints on file to check their identity, the department’s inspector general said in a stunning new report Monday.\n\nAt least two of those approved are now being investigated by the FBI for links to terrorism, investigators said.\n\nBut in most cases, Homeland Security and federal prosecutors have let the illegal immigrants-turned-citizens get away with their potential fraud. Charges were brought in just two of the more than 800 cases identified.\n\nOne of the persons granted citizenship through the error-riddled process is now a law enforcement officer, and three others worked in security-sensitive fields — including two who worked in sensitive areas at airports.\n\n“USCIS granted U.S. citizenship to at least 858 individuals ordered deported or removed under another identity when, during the naturalization process, their digital fingerprint records were not in the DHS digital fingerprint repository,” the inspector general said.\n\nThe 858 cases involved people from so-called “special interest” countries, or from neighboring countries with major immigration fraud problems. Special interest countries are those places the government has identified as posing national security problems to the U.S.\n\nWHAT’S EVEN MORE UNBELIEVABLE:\n\nInvestigators late last year identified another 953 cases that also seemed suspicious.\n\nThe problem, according to the audit, is tens of thousands of illegal immigrants and criminal aliens whose files are so old that their fingerprints are still on paper cards.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that approves applications, wasn’t checking those paper-based files, so it didn’t know the aliens were ineligible or had been ordered kicked out of the country already.\n\nThe inspector general said some fingerprints have been digitized, but it identified 148,000 aliens who have been ordered deported but whose fingerprints are not in the IDENT system the department uses for its fingerprint checks.\n\nRead more: WT",

Trending: FBI Discovered TEN TIMES Emails on Hillary Clinton The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.\n\nSo much for “white privilege,” huh George?!\n\nThe Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.\n\nThe Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?\n\nPretty much an environmental “no brainer,” unless you’re dealing with hypocrite Liberals, and crooked Chicago politics.",

Trending: Clash Poll: Who Is The REAL Dishonorable Republican — Trump or Romney? The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.\n\nIt’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:\n\nHere’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.\n\nAnd the link to the original.\n\nThat’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.\n\nThat was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:\n\nBreitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.\n\nIf Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?\n\nIf his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.\n\nBecause if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.\n\nThe quote can be read in context at Breitbart.",

Let the conservatives and the liberals beat the heck out of each other, and let the voters cheer whomever they like.\n\nWhat do they tell the voters about the trade policies that they sign? Why are these agreements kept locked up behind closed doors? Why is it that no one knows the details of these agreements until after the bills have been voted on and passed? Did they ask the voters if the trade agreements should be signed? Did they ask the voters if the agreements should be revoked or at least modified?\n\nThe Elite Businessmen have to make more money, even at the expense of American industry, and the free trade agreements are their sacred texts.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "Recent Bombings Show Why Donald Trump Will WIN!",
    "content": "In 2004 President George W. Bush ran a hard-fought reelection campaign against a popular, if doofy, Democrat opponent John Kerry. For all of his faults, Kerry was far more well-liked and far less scandal plagued than today’s Democrat candidate. Bush was able to eke out a reelection victory mostly on the shoulders of his decisive reaction to the 9/11 tragedy.\n\nIn fact, the 2004 election made the phrase “security moms” famous, as the once known “soccer mom” had suddenly awakened to our dangerous new world where Islamic terrorism was the reality and her “mama bear” instincts had taken over. The “security mom” knew she had to do all she could to care for her loved ones, and that now meant using her vote to keep them safe.\n\nFast forward 12 years to the 2016 presidential election and the new generation of “security moms” will soon be playing a pivotal role (again) in another national election. The 2016 version of these security minded voters seem to be preparing to hand the presidency to GOP candidate Donald Trump, and the events of this past weekend explain why.\n\nOn Saturday morning a pipe bomb exploded just before the start of a 5k fun run in Seaside Park, New Jersey. The event was called off and authorities swept the area finding two more unexploded devices. Later that night, a pressure cooker bomb exploded in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, injuring 29 people and sending the city into a panic. Shortly after the explosion authorities swept the surrounding neighborhood and found another unexploded device a few blocks away.\n\nCome Sunday morning, liberals and their friends in the media were busy condemning Donald Trump’s comments about the explosions being “bombs” and about the likelihood that we were witnessing a terrorist act. Trump’s opponents were practically hyperventilating about his “rash” response and his “haste” to judgment, all while arguing that there was “no evidence” of a connection to Islam or to terrorist organizations.\n\nThen late Sunday evening authorities arrested five “persons of interest” around the same time that 5 more bombs were being discovered in an Elizabeth, New Jersey train station.\n\nBy early Monday morning police had captured Ahmad Khan Rahami, a naturalized American citizen of Afghani descent, who was living in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Rahami, it turns out, was a “known wolf” with ties to international Muslim terrorism. By the time the East Coast was waking up, liberals were beginning to realize that Donald Trump had been right all along…\n\nConsider New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s comments on Sunday:\n\nAbsent a motivation, Mr. de Blasio suggested the word terrorism should not be used, shaking his head in disapproval at the notion that the basic facts of the bombing could be described that way.\n\n“Here is what we know: It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing — that’s what we know,” he said on Sunday, flanked by law enforcement officials at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan. “To understand there were any specific motivations, political motivations, any connection to an organization — that’s what we don’t know.”\n\nThe liberal reticence at calling terrorism terrorism never ceases to amaze me. It’s as though de Blasio believes that if you say the word terrorism you automatically mean that a Muslim person has carried out a violent act. Taking his own words – “It was intentional, it was a violent act, it was certainly a criminal act, it was a bombing…” this is the very definition of terrorism. It’s an act meant to incite a reaction. The only reason anyone would ever set off a bomb without some other concurring criminal act (like using a bomb to rob a bank), would be for terroristic purposes. Yet, de Blasio couldn’t bring himself to use the word and instead just described the act of terrorism to reporters. Even New York’s liberal Governor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), who was slow to call the act terrorism on Saturday, had changed his tune by Sunday. “A bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism. A bomb going off is generically a terrorist activity.”\n\nBut by Monday de Blasio’s tune finally changed.\n\n“We have reason to believe this was an act of terror,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said.\n\nA-duh. Here’s a newsflash, Bill… every other thinking person in America has already come to this conclusion. Thanks for joining us.\n\nMeanwhile, while de Blasio was busy dissembling, Hillary Clinton was busy using the terrorism to attack Donald Trump for being to hard on terrorism. I kid you not. Clinton’s argument is that Donald Trump’s mean words are going to make the terrorists dislike us even more, so they’re going to do more terroristy things.\n\n“I don’t want to speculate but here’s what we know about I think it is important for voters to hear this and weigh it in making their choice in November,” Clinton said. “We know that a lot of the rhetoric used by Donald Trump is being seized upon by terrorists.“\n\nClinton says Trump’s rhetoric has “given aid and comfort” to terrorists. Phrase is definition of treason. — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 19, 2016\n\nThis is an amazing argument to make, considering that the Obama/Clinton foreign policy era has been one of appeasement and uber-careful rhetoric (when it comes to Islam) and yet, Islamic terrorism is worse today than ever before!\n\nUltimately, it won’t be the cavalcade of corruption, or the litany of scandals, or the lies, or her obviously failing health that ends Hillary Clinton’s hopes of being President. No, it will be the glaring differences between Clinton and Trump on dealing with the very real threat we face from Islamic terrorism. More Americans will decide that to continue the Obama/Clinton policy of appeasement and apology would be insanity, and that America would be safer handing the reins of leadership to Donald Trump. The liberal response to this weekend’s terrorism is why Donald Trump will be elected the next President of the United States, and it’s why the terrorist supporters at CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood are so worried.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Last week Combetta pled the fifth when testifying before the house oversight committee last week, but wasn’t as tight-lipped when trying to find out information on how to strip Clinton’s e-mail address from already sent and archived emails from fellow IT experts on Reddit. In the end a fellow tech guy told him the only thing he could do is delete the emails\n\nThe evidence was first posted at 8chan, it consisted of Reddit posts from two years ago. The thread was titled “Here is clear proof that Hillary sought to destroy evidence,”\n\nHere is the guy who wiped Hillary’s server asking about how to do it on Reddit. Yes. Seriously. He also asks how to replace real emails with fake ones. His post happens right about the same time congress was requesting Clinton’s emails. He specifically said it was for a big name client who everybody would recognize. A Reddit post has been found from Paul Combetta (the IT guy who got FBI immunity and deleted Hillary’s emails) proving they were covering up for Hillary.

    "headline": "Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa",
    "content": "Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.\n\n“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”\n\n“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.\n\nRanbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”\n\n“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Prior to that, she served as the deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013.\n\nABedin parlayed a 1996 Whitehouse internship into a role as Mrs. Clinton’s Right Hand Man, or Woman.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is listed as the supervisor certifying Abedin’s designation as a “special government employee. This classification allowed Abedin to work for an outside consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, at the same time that she advised then Secretary of State Clinton.\n\nThe Clinton campaign reiterated Sunday that Clinton did not personally sign documents for Abedin, or other employees. Hillary Clinton’s name was listed in print, but the signature underneath was redacted by the State Department. The document caused a stir and led to media reports Clinton had lied about not having been involved..",

This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?\n\nHere is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!\n\nWatch this video first, and then the video below to get a closer analysis of what appears to be a phony rally for Hillary at\n\nhttps://twitter.com/WDFx2EU5/status/777263623915745280\n\nThis stunning video takes the viewer through and shows step-by-step where the audience is faked:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nCP3HIhQgLI\n\nHere is the actual video from C-Span to prove nothing was doctored in the videos above.

    "headline": "Obama Says it’s Time to Give up Liberty and SUBMIT to World Government",
    "content": "In his final speech to the worthless United Nations Security Council, Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah urged that Americans give up their liberty and sovereignty and submit to world government.\n\nIn stark contrast to founding father Benjamin Franklin, who uttered the famous words, “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety,” Obama called on Americans to give up more liberty for security.\n\n“We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints,” Obama said.\n\nHe then added that “powerful nations” like the United States must give up their autonomy to realize security.\n\n“I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.” Obama said.\n\nOf course, Obama was doing this to praise the United Nations, an organization that is anti-American, anti-Christian and totalitarian at its core.\n\nSo, what’s the problem? Obama is convinced and that should make us just fall in line? Wasn’t he the guy that was convinced Obamacare would lower costs and provide everyone with health insurance? Did that materialize? Nope. This man has lied through his teeth the entire time he has been in office and we’ve documented that.\n\nWhile Obama, a clear foreigner by his words, his wife’s word’s, a Kenyan Ambassador and the record of the Kenyan Parliament (despite what Trump and others say), claims that his view is the right one, he also acknowledges that real Americans, born and bred here, oppose him. These people do so rightly.\n\n“Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run…” Obama said. “We have to put our money where our mouths are.”\n\nYes, but the problem is America is not normal to the international community. She has been unique throughout her history. She was unique because her foundation was established upon the Bible, not upon “international norms,” which were pagan in origin. That’s what made America great.\n\n“I believe that at this moment we all face a choice,” Obama added after denouncing the building of a southern wall on the US border. “We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration or we can retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not back.”\n\nWhile I do agree with some bit of cooperation as in working with other countries on trade and things of that nature, which George Washington acknowledged we should do, I disagree with how Obama believes that we do that. His idea is to reward bad behavior, even to encourage it and to redistribute the wealth of the united States. That is not only unconstitutional, it’s immoral and wrong and he has no authority to do such things. Yet, Congress and the people have allowed him to do it.\n\nFinally, Obama stated that the United Nations was established to replace the ravages of war with peaceful cooperation. No, it was not. The majority of countries in the United Nations are either Communists, Socialists or Islamists. There is nothing peaceful about those ideologies in the least. As a friend of mine aptly stated, “They (the founders of the UN) wanted the organization they formed to be perceived as a dove when in reality it was to be a venomous snake.”\n\nThis is not the first time Obama has pushed this globalist mentality either. Remember when he addressed dignitaries and members of NATO in 2014? If not, click here to listen to that speech. Even conservatives were livid that we pointed out what he was actually saying.\n\nView the entire speech to the United Nations below.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "George H.W. Bush Says he’s Voting for HILLARY?!",
    "content": "It definitely wouldn’t be all that surprising if George H.W. Bush is voting for Hillary Clinton. After all, his son Jeb didn’t do all that well during the primary campaign, and in a show of opposition to Donald Trump, no one in the Bush clan showed up at the Republican National Convention for Trump’s coronation.\n\nThe Bushes themselves have remained mum on the subject of whom they’re voting for. In fact, they’ve pretty much stayed out of the presidential race altogether.\n\nBut one insider says the elder Bush of 92 years will be casting his vote for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThat insider is one of the late Robert F. Kennedy’s daughters, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend. She is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland.\n\nOn Monday, she posted a picture of her shaking hands with Bill Clinton’s predecessor with the caption: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!”\n\nAccording to Politico, Kennedy Townsend was visiting with the former President at his Maine summer home on Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport.\n\nLater in a phone interview with Politico, the Kennedy daughter confirmed, “That’s what he said.”\n\nBut when pressed about it, a spokesman for Bush would neither confirm nor deny. In an email to Politico, Jim McGrath wrote, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.”\n\nPolitico noted that George H.W. Bush wouldn’t be the first from his or his son’s administration to be voting for Hillary – or at least not voting for the Donald: “Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.”\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

He said officers couldn’t find a book at the scene.\n\n“It’s time for the voiceless majority to stand up and be heard,” said the police chief, who is black. “It’s time to change the narrative because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media.” – CNN\n\nBut…b…b…but what about the book?\n\nNeighbor who says she saw police shoot #KeithScott disputes CMDP's claim that he was armed with a gun. She says he had a book. @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/X1PWw5QJ7O — Mark Barber (@_MarkBarber_) September 21, 2016\n\nAnd of course, there’s Hillary’s irresponsible tweet confirming that the cops were in the wrong, without even having any facts to back up her ignorant statement:",

    "content": "Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.\n\nIn this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.\n\nInteresting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?

You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nTrending: FBI Discovered TEN TIMES Emails on Hillary Clinton\n\nThere are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.\n\nI recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.\n\nI further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.\n\nFurther rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.\n\nNo matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”\n\nWorse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.\n\nExpect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.",

    "content": "In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever, an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department of Justice and mainstream media have been unable (or unwillingly) to un-earth: Proof that Hillary Clinton conspired to cover up her “un-wise” use of a private server and email scandal. Through the power of social media, a Twitter user @GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation.\n\nPaul Combetta, the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State, allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary’s name from classified emails. He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “stonetear” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs.\n\nIn his requests for help from the public at large, Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “Unamed VIP Client” from email servers and archives.\n\nTrending: Obama: The Most Corrupt and America-Hating President in U.S. History\n\n“Hello all,” one of the posts begins. “I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone. … Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?”\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?

Completing this poll grants you access to iPatriot updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Reddit to save all relevant posts and data. Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish: proof of Hillary’s Clinton’s criminal activity.\n\nThe investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question: is the screen name “stonetear” definitively Combetta? In not, the evidence is circumstantial. If so, the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up.\n\nTo support the argument that “stonetear” is in fact Hillary Clinton’s IT specialist, @GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections:\n\nArchived domain records show the website combetta.com is registered to the email address stonetear@gmail.com.\n\nThe Etsy user stonetear lists his name as Paul Combetta. (The account was registered in 2011.)\n\nA website for the ’90s role-playing game Betrayal at Kondor, maintained by an unknown person, thanks a Paul Combetta for hosting some files and lists stonetear@gmail.com as his email address.\n\nAn archived profile on the site exiles.darkseduction.net, dated to February 2003, includes two pictures of a man who closely resembles Combetta, and who lists his names as “Paul” and “StoneTear” and his website as “putergot.net.”\n\nPutergod.net is, for what it’s worth, also registered to stonetear@gmail.com\n\nStonetear’s Reddit history — now deleted — made reference to Rhode Island, where Combetta once lived.\n\nThe email address stonetear@gmail.com was used to register a Facebook profile for a “Paul Hamilton,” which is mostly blank and has only 40 friends. One of them is, however, a woman whose maiden name appears to have been Combetta until a 2015 wedding.\n\nThe timing of two of Stonetear’s Reddit posts coincides with events in the Clinton email saga. One post, dated July 24, 2014, came one day after the House Select Committee on Benghazi and the State Department reached an agreement on producing records. The second, which is dated Dec, 10, 2014, and describes a 60-day email retention policy, came the same month that a longtime Clinton aide requested that their email retention policy be shortened to 60 days.\n\nThis story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them. As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee, the work of the American people, both as investigators like @GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot, will not remain silent.\n\n\"How to delete an IT guy who uses Reddit and make it look like an accident\"#ThingsHillaryGooglespic.twitter.com/P41uwzYWAD@realDonaldTrump — Boca Vista (@bocavista2016) September 21, 2016\n\nTags:\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author and are not not necessarily either shared or endorsed by iPatriot.com.",

Obama says this is a battle between those who are “hijacking” a religion of peace and those who believe Islam is a religion of peace.\n\nThis is the new normal for peace in our time ala Obama. America can expect Democrats to not only import cheap labor from Mexico and South America, but import Muslims from the Middle East as refugees from Obama’s New Jihad. As atonement for killing Sheik Osama bin Laden, Obama has armed, funded, and given American bomber support to the Muslim Brotherhood’s overthrown of Middle Eastern governments.

Assisting Islam to overcome the world is not going to make the world a better place. It’s going to make the world into the hellhole that the Muslim Middle East is today.\n\nObama’s Wars – making refugees, not peace\n\nREAD MORE…\n\nVisit, like, and share my Facebook page – The Left is never right\n\nSubscribe to iPatriot.com to see more of my articles.

    "content": "This very week, when Americans were shaken by yet several more violent attacks across the nation by Radical Muslim terrorists, we as a nation were shocked and numbed in disbelief by plans still firmly in place by the Obama administration to bring in 110,000 Muslim refugees from the Middle East this year.\n\nHillary Clinton, on the stump campaigning for President, vows to increase those numbers of poorly vetted Muslim immigrants to more than 620,000 her first year in office if elected. The stark raving madness of such plans is unfathomable.\n\nIt is a widely known fact that there is no means of screening this huge wave of Muslim immigrants to determine which among them are radical extremists and thus potential terrorists.\n\nTrending: Obama: The Most Corrupt and America-Hating President in U.S. History\n\nNor do we have any database to screen them for potential criminals or with criminal pasts.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? Has Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? * Yes No Maybe not treason but should be removed from impeachment inquiry\n\nEmail *\n\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Completing this poll grants you access to iPatriot updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nAdditionally we have no means to screen them to learn whether or not they are willing to assimilate into the mainstream culture and values of American life. Yet inexplicably, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are deadly serious in their hardened determination to bring these 600,000-plus Muslim immigrants to America at the very time that deadly acts of terrorism are on the increase by radical Muslims on American soil.\n\nThe number one job of the US President is to keep our citizens safe and secure. Yet to both American citizens in the various states and local communities, as well as among state and local elected officials it is increasingly obvious that security and safety is rapidly vanishing and that we are in “clear and present danger”.\n\nThe governors of at least two dozen states have forcefully opposed the immigration and resettlement of Muslims, not only because of the “no questions asked” open door policy, but also due to proven incidents of crime and violence by Muslim immigrants who were resettled by Obama in Twin Falls, Idaho, Minneapolis, Minnesota, New England and elsewhere.\n\nThis week Texas governor Greg Abbott flatly declared his firm refusal to resettle any additional Mideast Muslim immigrants in Texas, citing the potential dangers to American citizens and Texas residents for outright defiant refusal.\n\nWhile more than two dozen states, led again by Texas have sued the Obama administration for various and egregious abuses of power and unconstitutional executive overreaches meddling in state and local matters, the action this week by Texas governor Abbott consisted of an outright, defiant refusal.\n\nAs a writer with a strong knowledge of American history, the Constitution and the workings of government, Governor Abbott’s action on behalf of Texas this week strongly suggests the invoking of the Tenth Amendment protecting states’ rights, and thus the principle of nullification of unconstitutional federal acts against states.\n\nThe nullification principles have been debated in terms of scope and circumstantial legality at various times since before the Civil War. For decades after Union Victory nullification of unlawful federal action, as well as secession from the union, appeared to be settled as illegal. However, the Southern States resurrected the issues of nullification and secession during the battle over civil rights and racial integration in the 1950s and 60s. Given the “moral high ground” advantage owned by the Feds at the time the notion of nullification gained little political steam.\n\nThe past eight years of the Obama administration, which has wrought untold misery to Americans though both disastrous policies and increasingly lawless and unconstitutional executive actions, has revived the Tenth Amendment, states’ rights issue and the principle of nullification of unlawful federal actions by one or more states has been resurrected with a vengeance.\n\nWith radical Islamic terrorism spreading like wildfire around the world, including Europe and now in America, local officials and governors in over half the states are frantically working to find legitimate means to protect citizens and preserve the rule of law. Even the two centuries old “checks and balances” in three separate branches of government no longer apply; for two years the GOP majority in Congress utterly refused to check and limit the dangerous, lawless overreach of Obama’s executive branch, and numerous federal courts, including the Supreme Court have also failed to limit executive branch lawlessness.\n\nThe astounding rise of Donald Trump, the Tea Party, the open revolt against “Washington Political Establishment, along with the widely understood tyrannical executive actions by Obama that go unchallenged, State governors are banding together to fight federal tyranny. On the “frontier strip” an organization called “Free Nebraska” has led the way in partnership with similar movements in other states, to call for the convening of a”convention of states”. It appears very likely when analyzing these related events in clear resistance to dangerously growing federal power and control\n\nover issues that are in the prerogative of individual states, that the highly unusual and noteworthy action of the governor of Texas to directly confront the federal government and Mr. Obama,\n\nthat state-by-state nullification actions and declaring state government sovereignty under the “reserve clause” (powers reserved to the states)of the Tenth Amendment is a growing conflict.\n\nKnowing the tyrannical nature of the Federal Government, the growing power struggle escalating into a states’ rights nullification battle involving potentially a score or more of state governors is certain to quickly turn ugly and potentially violent.\n\nGiven the precarious political situation and this Presidential election the most consequential in American history, a nullification battle involving states’ rights to limit and push back against federal tyranny, the nullification battle begun by Texas appears very likely to further divide America as some state governments rebel and other states acquiesce.\n\nLet us pray to our Lord that freedom will be restored peacefully. However an already deeply divided America is being further divided and clearly leading to open rebellion, we must also pray for avoidance of civil insurrection.\n\nThe stark reality however, is that federal tyranny is clearly headed toward dictatorship, and the bitter but forced choice between liberty and tyranny will result in a ferocious struggle to restore American liberty and the outcome, while uncertain, is just as clearly leading to a historical confrontation and bitter conflict. May God bless America as we endeavor to confront and defeat the tyranny in Washington, D.C. Freedom comes with a price; to restore freedom to America that price will be high. Let us pray to Almighty God that He will empower us to overcome the monstrous evil we now face, and fight.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author and are not not necessarily either shared or endorsed by iPatriot.com.",

    "content": "“I really support everything President Obama said he would do through regulation on guns but we’re going to start the very first day and tackle the gun lobby.” – Hillary Clinton on MSNBC, 4/25/16\n\nThere are those who believe that the 2016 presidential election is a once in a generation, existential kind of national election. These folks notice all of the dangers we face and worry that depending on how the vote falls this November, we may soon be a very different nation than we’ve been.\n\nI’m not sure I fit on this worrisome boat, but I do believe that our dearest rights and freedoms are in danger today. The Left has developed a fascist streak unlike any we’ve seen previously in American history, and they believe it to be their duty to destroy our liberty… for our own good, of course.\n\n“The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment. And I am going to make that case every chance I get.” – Hillary Clinton, The Free Beacon, 10/1/15\n\nInto this caustic climate comes the NRA, an organization wholly devoted to defending the 2nd Amendment from the gun-grabbing left.\n\nThe NRA believes that if elected president, Hillary Clinton would do everything in her power to undermine and repeal the 2nd Amendment. Because of this, they are working hard to unmask her as the anti-freedom fascist she really is.\n\nTheir latest ad paints a disturbing picture, reminding all Americans what is really at stake in the upcoming election.\n\nThis is the second in the “Don’t Let Hillary Leave You Defenseless” series.\n\nThe previous ad covered the disgusting hypocrisy of Clinton’s anti-gun position. Here’s a woman who has lived the last 30+ years of her life surrounded by men with firearms, yet she has the audacity to tell law abiding American citizens that they shouldn’t have the right to use the same tool to defend their families?\n\nIf it wasn’t such a serious topic, it’d be laughable.\n\n“When it comes to guns, we have just too many guns.”— Hillary Clinton, USA Today, 4/20/2016\n\nIn November, you can actively defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. All you have to do is vote AGAINST Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Almost all the sectors of the economy suffer – grocery stores, factories, small farms, etc. The negative impact is obvious in many aspects. We can pay visits to small towns and the abandoned and boarded stores as we tour their dead downtowns.\n\nTalk to farmers, who live in poverty on their 100-acre farms. They are looking for jobs. The corporate farms, which have the money to influence politicians, push for regulations that the small farmers can’t afford. The neo-lords drive them out and buy more and more of their land turning them into peasants.\n\n[ Read Related Article: Who are the Neo-Lords?\n\nSmall business is the biggest creator of jobs. The middle class in America is suffering as a result of the elite-businessmen influencing legislation that destroys small business, and when they move their factories out of the country, they take what’s left of the jobs with them, leaving destruction in their wake.\n\nHigh taxes and other policies hurt big business, but kills small business. The increasing wealth in the hands of big business makes them more competitive. The foreign-made products that need cheap labor are welcome in the country since it is produced by our Big Business-men. They can move their factories abroad, while a small business can’t.\n\nOn the other hand, pharmaceutical companies, which do not need cheap labor, operate in America. They are left to abuse the market by enjoying the ban on medicines made abroad from entering the country. The government decided that medicines made in England, Germany, France, Japan, etc. can’t be sold in the United States. Ironically, some medicines produced in America are sold to Chinese patients for a fraction of what they charge American patients. In fact, China negotiated recently further drug price cuts with our patriotic companies, lowering the prices for the Chinese in some cases, to less than 50%.\n\nNow, let’s sneak under the table and listen to a conversation between two elite businessmen… one is a tycoon and the other is his young protégé:\n\n– We will make the lake deeper; we can fish with our big boats, and they will drown with their small boats.\n\n– What do you mean?\n\n– We will make the government build extra infrastructure that benefits our big business and kills the small business.\n\n– Don’t they pay more taxes than we do? The government will use that money to help us kill them?\n\n– Yes, we’ll put them out of business using their own money. Now, their customers are ours; we swallowed the market.\n\n– Oh, it looks like some of them survived!\n\n– Not for long – we’re getting bigger, we can sell cheap. 10% profit is good for us, but for a small business owner, it wouldn’t even feed his kids.\n\n– We did it. They are out of business….Wait a minute, the relatively bigger ones are still in business!\n\n– Hmm….a free trade agreement will finish them….We will tell the government to sign a couple of these agreements. The manufacturers can’t compete with the products made by the slaves in China.\n\n– How about us? Would we be able to compete with the Chinese products?\n\n– For sure, no. But you know what? We can move our business to China. They can’t do that. They are too small to do it.\n\n– It looks like with the cheap merchandise sold by some of the small service businesses are flourishing.\n\n– Not for long. They will boom, then after some time they will die. As we keep closing the factories, we will keep firing workers. These jobless workers will have no money to spend, and the market will diminish.\n\n– Wouldn’t that hurt us as well?\n\n– Yes and we’ll be bankrupt.\n\n– How would this be good for us?\n\n– Did you forget that the politicians are ours? The government will bail us out.\n\n– With tax money paid by the people whom we fired?\n\n– Yes, and the government will feed the smaller business to the bigger one. We will buy them, and the government will pay.\n\n– Wouldn’t this mean that we have to downsize?\n\n– Precisely, and we fire more workers.\n\n– You mean the workers who paid the taxes that the government used to buy the smaller business for us that they used to work for?\n\n– Yes, we kill them with their own sword. We starve them and their children with their own money.\n\n– We have a Democrat president and a Republican Congress. Which one will help us?\n\n– Both. They are ours. One would decide and the other would approve. After they yell at the executives and box their ears.\n\n– The market is smaller now, what are we going to do?\n\n– No harm. If the middle class is diminishing in America, it is growing in China. What we lose here, we’ll gain there.\n\n– Don’t you feel bad for America and the Americans?\n\n– Ah… I feel good for my money. We used to be British, now we are Americans, and soon we’ll be Chinese.\n\nThe king doesn’t care which kingdom he is ruling.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "content": "Over the weekend, Barack Obama addressed the Congressional Black Caucus for the last time as President. He hammered the Republican nominee and admonished black voters to vote for the Democratic nominee. He said he’d take it as a “personal insult” for members of the Black community not to vote for her. Here’s what he said:\n\n“If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn’t matter who we elect — read up on your history. It matters. We’ve got to get people to vote,” Obama said. “I will consider it a personal insult — an insult to my legacy — if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.”\n\nWell, there’s at least one member of the Black community who doesn’t care that it would be a personal insult to the president for him to vote not only against Hillary, but for Donald Trump. He goes by A.D. Bell, and according to his Twitter profile, he’s an “Army Vet, Realist Party Affil., Father, College Graduate, Man, Not a Liberal or a Conservative.”\n\nIn his video, Bell asks the President what he’s going to do to him, since he’s voting for Trump. When people say they’re “insulted,” they act on it, he said. “So, what are you going to do to me, Mr. Obama?” an incensed Bell asked. “I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted me for a long time. I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted black people for a long time.”\n\n“You know what I’m doing?! I’m voting against them!” he yelled, pointing to his camouflage ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.\n\nListen to what he had to say:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/I2146tlPyyQ\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "content": "Chapter II from my book The Trump Revolution (available at Amazon)\n\nRead Chapter I here.\n\nThe Dishonorable Businessmen! The Elite!\n\nBefore I start whipping the corrupt, dishonorable business men, I want to note two points:\n\nThe first point, this book is written from the point of view of a Capitalist who believes in honorable businessmen who, in turn, are responsible for building the country, and employing its people. With the “country,” I mean America, not China or Mexico.\n\nThe second point, I can hear someone saying Trump is a businessman and he is from the elite. Let me say something. When you play a sport and you want to be successful you follow the rules that are set for the game, even if you don’t like them. However, if you head the federation of that sport, you would have a chance to change the rules that you do not believe in.\n\nNow we are ready for the whipping.\n\nThe elite of this country, a group of very rich businessmen. They own almost everything including the media and the politicians. You can even call them the neo-lords.\n\nLet’s tell an old story that we all know to see where the neo-lords emerged from.\n\nAmerica is the land of the free. The peasants fled Europe from the oppression of their lords, the hunger, the illness, etc. They fled to America to live as free farmers, until the neo-lords grew again in the land of the free.\n\nAt the old time, the lord was the owner and the ruler. Now, the neo-lords, who are the elite businessmen, are the owners and they own the rulers, the politicians shall we say. They even went further, and decided to own the minds and hearts of the people, so they decided to own the media and they even penetrated the churches.\n\nThe lord-peasant system found its way again to the land of the free. The system developed. After a struggle, the American People adapted to the new system and forced their elite businessmen to adapt to the idea that they are dealing with free people. The elite businessmen uncomfortable with the idea that the American People are not peasants enough, they decided to leave to where they can find real peasants. They got their bought-off politicians to sign a couple of regional and international free trade agreements. The factories moved to China, Mexico and other countries as a consequence.\n\nApparently, the elite-businessmen found that their multi-billion dollars are not big enough fortune, so they moved to China to make an extra couple of billions of dollars on cheap labor. Probably, they were afraid that their children might starve and they need an extra couple of billions to make sure they are full.\n\nIn the transition, they are using America as a market, a dwindling market. It shrinks as more and more factories are closing and moving abroad. Consequently, more and more workers are laid off. And so, less shoppers and buyers. An economy cannot be sustained by the people selling services to each other and producing nothing.\n\nThe elite-businessmen are milking the cows to the last drop and slaughtering them one after one. Quite like the lords in the earlier history, when they are fed-up with a town and the people are harder to rule; they pillage it, burn it and move to another town to start again.\n\nThat is what the corrupt elite of the United States’ businessmen are doing. They use their politicians and their media to get the job done.\n\nThe corruption prevailed, but the free Americans figured out that there is something wrong and they started to revolt. They did not know where to start and what to do, so Donald Trump jumped in and decided to lead them.\n\nStand Up America, The Leader Is Here.\n\nSo how should an honorable businessman be?\n\nThe businessman is a career. Like any career, it has its duties and its ethics.\n\nSo what are the duties?\n\nThe businessman’s job is building the elements of the economy of the country using his special abilities; like his skills, knowledge, personal character etc. He has to take part in building the country. He has to be involved in forming and executing plans to develop the country. Before and after these, he is responsible for employing the people of his country and getting the best out of them. To accomplish that, he has to socially secure the lives of the workers to make them feel that the time and effort are worth giving. For the businessman to achieve this goal, he has to watch for the health of his workers, physical, mental and psychological. What I mentioned are not newly innovated ideas. Many companies are famous for their “good benefits and pay.” That’s what a businessman is supposed to do.\n\nWhat are our elite-businessmen doing?\n\nThey are shutting factories’ doors, they lay off workers and they move the factories to other countries. Then, they force the people of the United States to buy the products of the factories they moved to the other countries!!!\n\nI hate to be sarcastic, but “what a patriotic and responsible action.” I can hear them murmuring: “hmm……. The workers have to help themselves, to stand for themselves hmm…..”\n\nCongratulations for increasing your profits greedy Blood Suckers.\n\nImagine that all the American medical doctors decided to close the hospitals and to move them to another countries. So, to make more money, they leave the American patients to stand for themselves.\n\nImagine if a man decided to abandon his family for a rich woman leaving his wife and children to stand for themselves.\n\nWhat are the nationalities of these gluttonous misers?\n\nCould they have closed the factories without buying the politicians? The answer is no. Could they have done this without a cover-up from their media? The answer is no.\n\nSelfishness, greed. I would say treason.\n\nThe elite-businessmen formed an alliance against Donald Trump, why? He is the only politician who stood up and spoke out about getting the factories back to America. Don’t believe those who started to hijack his ideas after almost a year of campaigning, they found themselves loosing. They will not touch this subject when they get the presidency. They are just elite-businessmen’s pawns.\n\nIf they believe in getting the factories back, they would not have waited that long to mention it during their campaigns. They just found themselves loosing.\n\nThe elite-businessmen’s media\n\nHere we are talking about all of what is called the mainstream media. Most all the news channels owned by the elite-businessmen. Trump should be proud they are all against him. Have you ever seen any other candidate being grilled by them like they grill Trump? They pressure Trump as hard as they can then they catch any of his tongue-slips. They make stories and they keep wailing and screaming about these tongue-slips non-stop!!!\n\nWhat should the job of the media be?\n\nShowing the people the truth about what is happening. Displaying the real problems facing the people according to the people’s priorities. Explaining what is being plotted against them.\n\nThat is what they are supposed to do. But, what are they really doing?\n\nTranquilizing the people by dragging their attention to anything other than their real life problems. Entertaining the people and making them laugh and enjoy their life while the country is being set on fire.\n\nWAKE UP AMERICA!!!\n\nHave you ever seen CNN and her sister channels going with their cameras to show the closed, abandoned factories? Have you ever seen them roaming with their cameras in the streets of abandoned ghost towns? Did they interview laid off workers or the abused Walmart workers who are even being replaced by machines. Have they shown all of that on their screens?\n\nBut you know what? We are on the move, and we found a father, a leader who is listening to us, and speaks and acts on our behalf. Stand Up America, The Leader Is Here.\n\nThe elite-businessmen’s politicians\n\nWelcome to the employees of the elite-businessmen. They call them Senators, Representatives and even Presidents. They belong to two owned companies that are called political parties: Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMost of these politicians in the last 50 years are bought and sold. They are playing a game they call an election. The rule of the game; let the people get indulged in ideological battles, conservatives against liberals but make sure they don’t break free from the exploitation of the elite-businessmen. It does not matter who wins, the factories were sent and being sent abroad by Republican presidents, Democratic presidents, Republican Congress, Democratic Congress etc.\n\nWere the people asked to approve or disapprove the free trade agreements? I mean were these agreements among the issues the candidates were talking about in their election campaigns before they signed them?\n\nThe people are only allowed to make the country 5% more conservative or 5% more liberal. It looks like Trump is taking it far away, beyond what the people are allowed to change.\n\nLet me recite a scenario that would show how a catastrophic decision would be taken behind the people’s backs:\n\nThe elite-businessmen speaking to a to-be-president:\n\nYou look like you can make a good president…\n\nYou are smart or else we wouldn’t have approached you…\n\nWe will make you president in return for a favor…….\n\nWe want you to do so and so….\n\nIf you don’t follow, we will destroy you….No second term…..and/ or big scandal….\n\nYou get us angry and you are a dead dog….\n\nEnd of the scenario.\n\nIt is literally a deal with the devil. They ask the politician for a catastrophic decision that feeds their greed and harm the people.\n\nListen Greedy-Hearts, no more of these dirty tricks.\n\nStand up, America. Donald J. Trump is here.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "CIA Director John Brennan Confesses Support for COMMUNIST Party",
    "content": "Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah’s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election.\n\nLast week, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference, Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n“I froze,” Brennan said. “This was back in 1980, and I thought back to a previous election where I voted, and I voted for the Communist Party candidate.”\n\nClaiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech, he said he decided to answer truthfully.\n\n“We’ve all had indiscretions in our past,” he said. “I would not be up here if that was disqualifying.”\n\n“I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, ‘OK, here’s the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'” Brennan said.\n\nThe question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act, which “prohibit[ed] certain subversive activities,” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence. Thus the question that is routinely asked is,\n\n“Have you EVER advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?”\n\n“I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change,” Bennan added. “I said I’m not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, ‘OK,’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, ‘Well, I’m screwed.'”\n\nBrennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating, “So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, ‘I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall’ … and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that’s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government.”\n\nIt’s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi, wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress, but kept it classified, is known as a bully, and has continued to help aid America’s enemies in the Middle East. We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible, but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1957, many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism. According to Wikipedia:\n\nHowever, June 17, 1957, Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept.”\n\nHowever, consider that that new Cold War, which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us, is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan, Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power? And do you really think they are not out to silence your opposition to you? If you do, then you are a part of the problem.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

These are not protestors, these are criminals.”\n\n“I’m not saying all the people, but we’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can say probably about 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”\n\nIn fact, according to police, these troublemakers were bused in from out of state just to wreak havoc on the city. We saw the same thing happen in Ferguson.\n\n#Charlotte police: 70% of arrested protesters had out of state ID’s, outside entities are causing these problems https://t.co/Kwya2xXerk — OutFrontCNN (@OutFrontCNN) September 22, 2016\n\nThese people are purportedly protesting systemic racism in law enforcement. While that is something that might be worthy of discussion – definitely not worth looting a Walmart over – what’s interesting is that the cop who shot Keith Scott was a black man himself.\n\nAccording to Scott’s family, he didn’t have a gun and claimed that he was reading a book while waiting for his son. However, after Keith Scott was shot, police recovered no book from the scene, but did recover a small, loaded handgun.\n\nHere’s cell phone footage that Keith Scott’s wife took during the incident.\n\nWarning: Language\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcoNUhFyP1o\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "Liberals Try to Tear Down 9/11 Memorial! • Tabitha Korol • iPatriot",
    "content": "The Children of Abraham of the Southern Tier, an interfaith organization in Johnson City, has taken offense at the 9/11 memorial raised in the nearby Town of Owego, New York. This association of misguided multiculturalists and Muslim moderates allege that identifying the perpetrators of the worst individual act of aggression on American soil would encourage Muslim hatred, never once excoriating the very act that resulted in the death and injury to more than 3,000 American victims and 453 responders and boundless grief for their families and for all Americans.\n\nDid the moderates ever attempt to apologize for the horrific crime that forced people to jump to their death rather than be burned alive? Did they express their sorrow for the victims and heroic rescue workers, or atone in a way to benefit the families that suffered such tragic loss? Do they even acknowledge that Islamic terrorists continue their march of evil, putting America and Europe on high alert for 9/11, or that this was part of Islam’s perpetual holy war against every living being on the planet. No. And the city manager’s overtures were also snubbed.\n\nThe Muslim residents of Johnson City may be moderates who never take up a lethal weapon for Allah, but they are engaging in a subtle act of civilizational or settlement jihad. Such people are comparatively discreet in Western society, going about their lives inconspicuously, but effecting regime changes in gradual increments. By their refusal to acknowledge the obvious links between Islam and 9/11, they shield those who spew hatred against America, Israel and democracy; they empower the academics and students who vilify Israel and Jewish students on campus, and they facilitate the crossing of borders for hijra (conquest by increased population). Under the guise of injured sensibilities, they insist on the removal of anything that may identify those who pursue our destruction and conquest with Islam, hoping to erase the ugly truth that fourteen centuries of barbarism continues unabated in every country where Islam is found.\n\nTrending: Obama: The Most Corrupt and America-Hating President in U.S. History\n\nThey would have us believe that a tiny minority is to blame, but a recent Pew Research poll shows that 51 percent of American Muslims choose to be governed by sharia; 30% believe it is legitimate to use violence against those who insult Muhammed, the Koran, or Islam; 25 percent believe violence against Americans can be justified as part of the global jihad; and nearly 20% believe the use of violence in the US is justified in order to make sharia the law of the land. When presented with a choice when sharia conflicts with the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, 33% say sharia should be supreme. That’s some minority! Politically, 48% are Democrats, 19 percent Independents, and 19 percent Republicans.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? Has Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? * Yes No Maybe not treason but should be removed from impeachment inquiry\n\nEmail *\n\nPhone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Completing this poll grants you access to iPatriot updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nIslam already regulates our speech through our government, our media, and the constant hazard of being damned as Islamophobic to those who dare to speak up. They cover their tracks through leftist academics, a strong BDS movement, and textbooks crammed with indoctrinal and fallacious material. Continuing along those lines, the Johnson City assemblage is working to remove from future knowledge the history of 9/11 that was carved into the granite. If we fail to yearly observe significant events as the bombing of the World Trade Center, the signing of our Declaration of Independence, our victory in World War II, and more, our youth will be robbed of their identity, their heritage, and America as we know it. Wisdom is defense. Ignorance of our journey through history is the greatest threat to our survival.\n\nIt should be noted that this interfaith group’s complaint was not that they, too, should have paid homage to America’s fallen or, specifically, to Owego’s citizen, Derek Statkevicus, who lost his life that day. Neither were they inspired to erect a monument in their own city or to join Owego residents in a fight against the greatest scourge of mankind with its unspeakable crimes done in the name of their religion. Rather, they express a phony outrage that the criminals have been identified with Islam! Often enough, other Islamic groups attempt to blame 9/11 on American citizens, on Jews or Christians, but this one is working to eliminate the obvious first, to claim that the 19 were unknown, came out of nowhere, and bombed America for no specific reason. Removing the offensive truth from the monument will leave room for revisionism later, just as Major Nidal Hassan (Fort Hood Massacre) was called anything but what he was, and his jihad massacre was officially named “workplace violence.”\n\nInstead of condemnation or owning up to the demands for death inherent in the Koran, these individuals hope to gradually erase the event from our memory and from generations to come – just as Islamists have obliterated or renamed many artifacts and historic tombs to create their own narrative, just as their counterparts in Israel are trying to stop archaeological excavations from revealing more of Jewish history. These Children of Abraham may well be the Islamic families that escaped tyranny but, unfortunately for the rest of us, they nurture their children with intolerance and harshness, creating a new, young generation of jihadists. These offspring may become the young men enticed online to join ISIS’ executioners, or the young women lured to sexual slavery for the Palestinian cause.\n\nWe must continue to remind ourselves of the anger, the tears, and the patriotism that were triggered that day of September 11th, fifteen years ago, and realize that we are in more danger now than ever before. The Middle East has grown bolder and more violent. Islamists are acquiring newer, deadlier weapons, and more of their numbers are making their way into Europe, North and South America, bringing with them new plans to terrorize and infuse their way of life into ours. Islam has been at war with the world since the seventh century. Their holy book is a dedication to brutality and conquest, so that even their own people are condemned to grope in the darkness of oppression and poverty. In the name of their god, they must erase the past to support their own supersessionist narrative, and we must never oblige them. The more that Americans accommodate such requests and attempt to correct or crush our own speech, the more power we will hand to them. Unless we weigh the long-term ramifications of the growing adjustments we make to our lives for the sake of theirs, we will lose our freedoms to their tyrannical sharia laws.\n\nIn the words of Hassan al-Banna, creator of the Muslim Brotherhood (1929), “It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its laws on all nations and extend its laws to the entire planet.” If the hate feared by the Children of Abraham does arise, it will be because of Islamists’ deeds, not the attribution on a memorial stone.\n\nTags:\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author and are not not necessarily either shared or endorsed by iPatriot.com.",

    "content": "Matt Lauer is being skinned alive by the leftwingnut media for his honest presidential forum with Hillary and Trump. They are calling for his head on a platter for asking Hillary about her email crimes.\n\nThe rightwing saw the interview as a surprise since leftists normally do their utmost to shield Hillary and avoid exposing her crimes. But then they saw that Lauer didn’t go into as much detail as they would have and that he did go after Trump, but not to the degree with which leftist fanatics would have and that has sent those leftwingnuts over the edge. In the coming debate between Trump and Hillary they are calling on their moderators to “fact check” Trump, but not Hillary.\n\nThe purpose of journalism is to inform you of events. You are then free to decide your opinion of those events. Opinions expressed in the media are supposed to be from either the public or the editors. But that is not what the leftist media practices today. Remember the 2nd Romney-Obama debate? The moderator took over debating Romney and backed Obama’s lie that he said the assassination of Ambassador Stevens was a terror attack. Even though she admitted she lied the next day the damage was done.\n\nTrending: Obama: The Most Corrupt and America-Hating President in U.S. History\n\nI am not a journalist. I have a degree in journalism, but that doesn’t make me a journalist. I do not work for the media and I do not report the news. I am a blogger. I do not report events. I express my opinion of events. Before you read my articles I expect you to already know the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of events. If you are ignorant because you listen to the leftwingnut media spin then you will probably think my opinion is wrong because you think my facts are lies. There are leftwingnuts who have chastised bloggers as false because we express our opinions, as if by doing so that makes what we say not the truth. Expressing your opinion of an event does not make the facts of that event a lie – except in the narrow minds of ignorant liberals.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? Has Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? * Yes No Maybe not treason but should be removed from impeachment inquiry\n\nEmail *\n\nComments This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nI have also been chastised that I do not make good arguments because I am not politically correct and considerate of people’s feelings. I’m from the Forrest Gump/Larry the Cable Guy school of education and believe that “Stupid is as stupid does” and “You can’t fix stupid.” Intelligent people will learn from what I write and if they are ignorant of the facts I present they will take the time to learn. The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that ignorance is a lack of knowledge that can be amended through education. Stupidity is an inability to learn, whether accidentally or purposely, and cannot be cured, but must be defeated. The reason we have Obama is because stupid people believed what he said rather than examined his background and elected him on the basis of lies.\n\nBack in the eighties, I stopped watching television news when I realized all of it was biased anti-Reagan BS. Reagan undid the Fairness Doctrine that Democrats had inflicted on media back under Truman so that they could control the media’s content. With that boot lifted of the throats of conservatives there arose the rightwing media led by Rush Limbaugh and FOX News. Rush has been a godsend expressing the opinions of the Silent Majority that had not permitted to speak over the airwaves. Add to that a network that not only reported events, but had both sides express their opinions and the Moral Majority not only had a voice once again, but was able to debate with liberals openly so that both sides could be heard together! That’s why leftists want to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine to shut us down and silence us again. It’s not about making the Internet fair, it’s about censoring what is right and true.\n\nThis is the dirty little secret that the Left doesn’t want people to know, which is why they say FOX News lies about everything. Whenever someone actually watches FOX and the Democrat media side-by-side they discover that the Left is a pack of looney lies and they can get far more of the truth and good sense from FOX. Even listening to liberals on FOX trying to twist the truth in their arguments with conservatives reveals their ideology to be based on deception. But Trump’s relentlessness has forced the Left to come out from under their cover as supposed journalists and reveal themselves to be nothing more than Democrat propagandists. The result is that the people no longer trust the media.\n\nTMZ’s Harvey Levin declares media made themselves irrelevant\n\nCNN busted inserting words Trump didn’t say to make him look racist\n\nCNN edits out Hillary calling NY terror attacks “bombings” like Trump\n\nREAD MORE…\n\nVisit, like, and share my Facebook page – The Left is never right\n\nSubscribe to iPatriot.com to see more of my articles.

    "headline": "Trump's Novel Way Mexico Will Pay for the Border Wall",
    "content": "Many reasons exist to build a border wall between Mexico and the United States.\n\nLack of a border wall has allowed illegal drugs to decimate American society. Further, drugs have enriched foreigners beyond imagination.\n\nEl Chapo was so wealthy, he had a private zoo. He was said to import animals from all over the world for his viewing pleasure. An empire built by drug money.\n\nForeigners involved in drugs make billions of dollars, and impact governments with their corruption. It’s time America fight back, and Trump has a novel approach.\n\ntake our poll - story continues below\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? Has Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe?\n\nHas Adam Schiff committed fraud and treason concerning the Trump probe? * Yes No Maybe not treason but should be removed from impeachment inquiry\n\nEmail *\n\nName This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Completing this poll grants you access to The Black Sphere updates free of charge. You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nTrending: FBI Discovered TEN TIMES Emails on Hillary Clinton\n\nIn Trump’s recent immigration speech, he assured America that Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall “100 percent.” The Mexican cartels may be how Trump plans to pay for the wall.\n\nAccording to LifeZette, a senior Trump campaign official, a president Trump would consider using assets seized from Mexican drug cartels to finance the construction.\n\nYou have to admire this type of thinking; using funds seized from the illegal drug trade to stop the illegal border activities.\n\nA wall is not the only solution, but consider what the wall does.\n\nFirst, building the wall provides construction jobs. The Left constantly talk about “roads and bridges,” but don’t like building wall, unless the walls surround their residences.\n\nTrumps wall would cost around $8-10 billion dollars, money that could spur the economy.\n\nNext, the wall would lessen the flow of illegals into America. The objective of the wall is to force people to use our LEGAL immigration system.\n\nThe plan reportedly would involve “joint border security fund,” in which seized assets from both sides of the border would be deposited and used to build and maintain the border wall “to the benefit of both Mexico and the United States.”\n\nThe funding?\n\nThe Justice Department seized $8.7 billion in drug money in 2015 alone, according to an audit. There’s no telling how much we’ve accumulated. Further, that figure doesn’t include assets seized by the Mexican government.\n\nThe wall won’t stop the illegal drug trade, but it certainly will put a dent into the flow of drugs coming to America.\n\nThe wall represents an attack on the drug cartels. These groups menace Mexico, and their crimes undoubtedly affect people in the United States. The wall begins the fight against corruption, drugs, human trafficking, illegal immigration, and terrorism in one fell swoop.\n\n“For decades, the illicit drug and arms trade has endangered and destroyed the lives of countless Mexicans and Americans,” an anonymous Trump immigration adviser said. “It would be sweet justice to use their illegal profits and property for something good.”\n\nTrump thinks differently than Washington. His type of thinking is what America needs.\n\nH/T Newsmax",

    "content": "The Drudge Report has gained access to the rules for the upcoming Mega-Debate between Hillary and Trump. Hillary’s always angling for an advantage, and when it comes to the mainstream media, Hillary usually gets exactly what she wants. It looks like she’ll get a custom podium to help her with the height advantage, but when it comes to coughing up a lung, Hillary’s on her own. Let’s hope for Hillary’s sake, she’s able to keep the guy with the diazinon pen close to the stage in case “unfit to run for office Hillary” has another “pneumonia-related incident” like the one on 911…\n\nDEBATE RULES: NO COUGHING BREAKS\n\n**Exclusive**\n\nFri Sep 23 2016 11:30:40 ET\n\nIf presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton slips into a coughing fit or any other medical crisis during Monday’s high-stakes debate, she will have to power through, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned!\n\n“There are no commercial breaks,” a commission source explains. “Period.”\n\nDebate moderator Lester Holt does not have the authority to cut away from the stage during the epic 90-minute showdown. And microphone audio for either of the candidates is not to be manipulated.\n\nClinton has experienced severe coughing episodes throughout the election year. During a Labor Day campaign stop she suffered a 4-minute choking marathon.\n\nMonday’s throwdown could top out at 100 million viewers, making it the biggest political event in history.\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: The presidential debate commission settled an early flashpoint when Clinton demanded a step-stool at the podium to add height to her 5’4″ frame. Campaign Chairman John Podesta expressed concern that Hillary would be dwarfed by 6’2″ Trump. The request was quickly rejected. The commission is allowing for a custom-made podium, which will accommodate the difference in stature.",

    "content": "A Daisy of a Rerun\n\nI am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.\n\nThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.\n\nToday, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.\n\nI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.\n\nObviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.\n\nSomehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.\n\nInstead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.\n\nNow, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”\n\nAs the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.\n\nSchools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?\n\nAnother safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.\n\nIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.\n\nAlso, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.\n\nThese quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.\n\nWith that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”\n\nObviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.\n\nAlso during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”\n\nApparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.\n\nAgain, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "Why Aren’t the Out-of-State Rioters Facing FEDERAL Charges?",
    "content": "On Friday, I reported that of those arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina, 70% of the provocateurs and rioters were from out of state. However, one writer is now questioning why they are not facing federal charges of crossing state lines in order to engage in rioting and destruction.\n\nJames Lonstreet writes at The American Thinker that the Department of Justice has a “disinterest for certain laws” and it has engaged in “non-enforcement of the law has become sport in the past eight years.”\n\nLonstreet says that the number of out of state rioters who have been arrested should pique the interest of the DOJ, but it doesn’t. Instead, the Justice Department has become so corrupt that it no longer seeks justice.\n\nHe writes:\n\nCriminals disguised as protestors cross state lines to engage in destruction and rioting. Has anyone heard of the statute that prohibits crossing state lines to engage in such behavior being enforced by federal authorities? From the Federal Judicial Center, 2101. Riots: (a) (1) Whoever travels in interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce or uses any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, with intent –\n\n(A) to incite a riot; or (B) to organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or (C) to commit any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; or (D) to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot; and who either during the course of any such travel or use or thereafter performs or attempts to perform any other overt act for any purpose specified in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. (b) In any prosecution under this section, proof that a defendant engaged or attempted to engage in one or more of the overt acts described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and (1) has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce, or (2) has use of or used any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including but not limited to, mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television, to communicate with or broadcast to any person or group of persons prior to such overt acts, such travel or use shall be admissible proof to establish that such defendant traveled in or used such facility of interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nThere is a wisdom to such laws, one that predicts how local situations can blossom into much larger events when interlopers are allowed to exacerbate the situation. These laws need to be enforced. They are not. It is fair to ask, “Why not?” Recall in Ferguson that the influx of non-residents (Revolution Club of Chicago, New Black Panthers, etc.) who came to join in the fray was noted by local authorities, yet there was no action from federal authorities regarding the enforcement of statues prohibiting the crossing of state lines to engage in such behavior. Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. (June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 808; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)” source\n\n\n\nHe then concludes, “There are two clarities. The administration has sympathies in one direction, and the Department of Justice has disinterest in another direction.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Lonstreet has brought this issue up. In 2014, he wrote on the issue when it was the New Black Panthers stirring up rioting in Ferguson, Missouri. At that time, he cited the same law and wrote, “The proof is for all to see. The New Black Panthers once again are not prosecuted at the choice of federal authorities. (Recall Philadelphia polling incident.) Need we mention who those authorities are?”\n\nPicking and choosing which laws to enforce is problematic for sure. This administration not only often targets innocent Americans, but then allows the lawless to escape punishment. Perhaps it’s time the people brought justice upon their criminal representatives in DC and institute new government, as the Declaration of Independence advises us to do.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "headline": "Abortion Proponent Says Taking Away Federal Funding of Abortion is SLAVERY",
    "content": "You’ve probably seen the bumper stickers that say, “Don’t like abortion? Don’t have one!” Perhaps during the slavery debate in our country, a similar bumper sticker could have read, “Don’t like slavery? Don’t own one!”\n\nProponents argue that abortion doesn’t affect most people, so people shouldn’t care. It’s between a woman and her doctor. They say that pro-lifers shouldn’t be able to force their worldview down everyone else’s throats. They shouldn’t be able – through legislation – to “force” childbirth on women who don’t want to have babies.\n\nSo, since the issue isn’t affecting anyone, except the mother – and the baby who doesn’t get a say, but that’s beside the point – it should be left solely up to the woman and her right to do with her body what she wants. (Even though the baby isn’t her body.)\n\nYou could say the same thing about slavery. It didn’t affect anyone except the slave owner – and the slave, but they didn’t view slaves as people then (kind of like how unborn babies aren’t people either) – so, if you didn’t like slavery, good for you. Don’t own any. And don’t force your worldview down everyone else’s throats.\n\nWell, here’s one activist and head of an abortion rights group who’s comparing abortion to slavery. Except, she’s arguing that not allowing federal funding for abortion is tantamount to slavery. And allowing federal funding for abortion would be “setting women free.” Here’s CNS News:\n\nKierra Johnson, executive director of URGE: Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity, testified Friday before the House Judiciary Committee examining the Hyde Amendment, which forbids the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape and incest, and compared the amendment to slavery, saying that repealing the Hyde Amendment is about “setting us (women) free.” Johnson responded to a question on the impact of the Hyde amendment on low-income women, referencing an earlier comment from Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) in which he compared the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision to abortion, saying, “It’s interesting that we’re bringing up slavery in this space. When you own somebody’s decision-making, you own them.” “The Hyde amendment is about increasing coverage of insurance,” she argued. “It is about returning decision-making back to women. It’s about setting us free. “When you get to decide for them whether or not their body has value, you own them whether you decide they’re valuable as black or not, you actually don’t get to make that decision,” Johnson emphasized. “We are valuable, and women are valuable. The Hyde amendment simply says set us free,” she said. “We are not simple-minded. We are not being duped. Women are choosing to be pregnant and have children. The majority of women who have abortions are parents. They care, they care about their families.” “We should repeal the Hyde Amendment,” she concluded.\n\nThere should be no federal funding for abortion, period, regardless of how the baby was conceived. In the vast majority of cases, people want abortion for convenience. They want sex without consequences.\n\nEven in the cases of rape and incest – while those instances are tragic – you don’t punish the baby. It wasn’t the baby’s fault. The baby merely becomes an innocent bystander. Instead of punishing the baby, the rapist should be the one to be aborted.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

    "content": "Famed television host and veteran Montel Williams got into it this weekend with Trump-supporting Pastor Mark Burns, who took to Twitter to complain about the mainstream media’s refusal to jump to conclusions and immediately call the weekend’s bombing in New York “terrorism.”\n\nMontel, a New Yorker, was not about to let the Trump apologist get away with repeating the same fear-mongering narrative that Trump repeats after every terrorist attack that takes place in the West. Montel called him and Trump out for being a con men, shaming him for being a pastor with the nerve to support a narcissist like Trump.\n\nDonald Trump clearly believes that he is a minor deity and has no concern for anything but his own ambitions, and Pastor Burns’ support for him is an obviously opportunistic move by a man willing to sacrifice his principles for money. Williams is absolutely right to call him out on it.\n\nA bombing suspect over the explosion in Chelsea and the placing of several other improvised explosive devices throughout New Jersey is in custody.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "In another disgusting display of Donald’s Trump selfish priorities, the Republican presidential nominee rushed to defend himself and the ignorant comments he made on the New York City bombings immediately after the attack, before having any official information on the matter whatsoever.\n\nFacing major backlash from the media for his audacity, Donald Trump decided to double-down on his irresponsible comments instead of admitting he had spoken out of turn. “The Donald” claimed that not only was he was right to rush to call the attack a “bomb,” he also deserved credit from the media for having “predicted it” before they confirmed it, when in fact the media was busy doing their due diligence to present the facts and not report the event so carelessly.\n\nTrump went on Fox News to say, “What I said was exactly correct. I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news. But what I said was exactly correct and everybody says, “While he was right, he called it too soon.”\n\nDonald Trump’s priorities are clearer now more than ever. Time after time, whenever tragedy strikes, Trump finds a way to make it about himself – no condolences for the 29 injured, and his self-aggrandizing knows no bounds, even when there are American lives at stake, and sensitive material that needs to be treated with careful consideration.\n\nAs of this morning, a suspect is in custody.\n\nIs this the way we should expect Donald Trump to behave if elected Commander-In Chief? Not on our watch.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump slams “dishonest” CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as ‘bombing’ pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "An independent examiner has determined that Tyre King, the 13 year-old African-American boy fatally shot by Columbus, OH police last Wednesday, was “more likely than not” running away from an officer at the time he was shot. The conclusion would seem to contradict the official police narrative, which holds that King was shot in a confrontation with officers after “he pulled a realistic-looking BB gun on them”.\n\nKing was shot at 7:42 pm last Wednesday after officers responded to reports of an armed robbery over $10 by a group of three African-American teenagers. According to the official police department report, “officers followed the males to an alley and attempted to take them into custody when one suspect pulled a gun from his waistband. One officer shot and struck the suspect multiple times.”\n\nThe Columbus coroner’s office has completed an autopsy of King’s body but the results won’t be made public for at least six weeks. It was this delay that prompted King’s family to hire an independent medical examiner, Dr. Francisco Diaz, who is a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan and works as a medical examiner for Wayne County, MI. In a statement released by the King family’s attorney today, Diaz said that “based on the location and the direction of the wound paths it is more likely than not that Tyre King was in the process of running away from the shooter or shooters when he suffered all three gunshot wounds.”\n\nIt is not in question that King was involved in the robbery; indeed his friend Demetrius Braxton, 19, who was with King that night and has since been arrested, said that King “wanted to rob somebody for money.” Diaz’s report, however, confirms the suspicions of many in the community and across the country that the use of lethal force by responding officers was unnecessary and that a story of King aiming his gun at the police had been concocted as a justification. Indeed Braxton’s account of the encounter, given before the results of Diaz’s investigation were reported, similarly contradicts the official narrative. He told the local newspaper that “the cops said ‘get down’ and We got down, but my friend [King] got up and ran … [and] when he ran, the cop shot him.”\n\nThe last time we checked, petty thievery does not carry the death sentence in the United States of America. While many will be inclined to somehow argue that the boy deserves it for committing a robbery, consider this. When young white men are convicted of rape in America, like Brock Turner, judges let them walk because they think they deserve a second chance. When young African-Americans commit crimes, they are smeared as career criminals and executed on the spot.\n\nThe King case is only the most recent in a long string of deadly encounters between young African-American men and the police, many of which have been muddled by the victims’ having been carrying BB guns made to look like authentic firearms. Given the ubiquity not only of BB guns but of actual firearms as well amongst white Americans the implication – and sometimes overt justification – by police that the mere presence of what looks like a weapon on a young African-American boy constitutes a deadly threat is questionable at best.\n\nThe injustice of such encounters becomes even clearer when the victim has his back to the police, a situation in which lethal force should never be the answer. And what is most insidious about these cases is the apparently reflexive instinct of the police to lie, as they seem to have done in King’s case by claiming that he was pointing his weapon at officers when he was shot. Far more than the peaceful protests of Black Lives Matter, it is these fabricated standoffs between police and black youth that fuel the fiction of the “war on police.”\n\nThrough their attorney, King’s family have asked that the public “continue to withhold final judgement until all the facts are known and vetted.” They have also called for an independent investigation into their son’s killing, saying that “The Columbus police department, the City of Columbus and most importantly Tyre King and his family deserve the benefit of an investigation from a law enforcement agency that has no direct impact from the outcome of that investigation.”\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "DON’T FORGET: Trump Supports Slashing Your Social Security From A ‘Moral Standpoint’",
    "content": "475572 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest\n\nSocial Security has been called the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you die. And if that is indeed the case, then Donald Trump might want to start picking out a nice casket.\n\nBloomberg reported back in 2016, that when the then-GOP nominee met with Paul Ryan on May 12, he told the House Speaker that he does indeed favor cutting Social Security, but he’s afraid to say so publicly because it would doom his chances in November. Bloomberg cites an unnamed source who was in the room when the meeting was held.\n\nAccording to the source, Trump told Ryan:\n\n“From a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And there’s no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ‘We’re going to cut your Social Security’ and the Democrat is saying, ‘We’re going to keep it and give you more.’ “\n\nThis is in stark contrast to what Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail and in office. Trump has said time and time again that he would leave Social Security alone.\n\nBut as you can see in this video he’s doing just the opposite.\n\nAlex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, believes the real intent of Trump is the same as that of most Republicans: Drastically cutting benefits while pretending to support the program:\n\n“It is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.\n\n“In his eyes the ‘moral’ thing to do is to steal people’s hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.”\n\nAs we have seen repeatedly during the 2016 campaign and into his presidency, Trump lies about everything, reverses his positions on issues by the hour, and often seems to be utterly lost when asked for specifics about various policy questions. The man is an idiot. He is also a danger to the very essence of American democracy.\n\nFeatured image via YouTube.",

All in all, we can probably guess this is not how Congressman Zeldin planned on this tweet working out for him. Lets hope this bully learns his humiliating lesson, and stop trying to exploit a national scare to increase his national profile.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "JUST IN: Trump To Pick Oil Tycoon Who Hates Animals To Oversee National Parks",
    "content": "When Republicans decided to vote for a guy who promised skip pandering to oligarchs for money, little did they know their presidential nominee meant to hand control of America’s highest offices to those very billionaires directly.\n\nWord has leaked that Donald Trump plans to nominate oil executive Forrest Lucas as Interior Minister, breaking the long tradition of naming those from the rural Western states to lead the agency which manages America’s public parks, lands and wildlife.\n\nThis would be disastrous for the fair enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, protecting the environment from the devastating effects of fracking, and animal rights in general, because Forrest Lucas is the sort of man who literally fights for the right to exploit animals in entertainment and is an avowed enemy of the Humane Society which provides low cost veterinary services, spaying and neutering to pet owners across the USA, as Politico writes:\n\nLucas, who owns a ranch and serves on Trump’s agriculture advisory committee, is one of the biggest donors to groups that attack the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and defend animal agriculture, hunting, meat consumption, rodeos and circuses. Another source with knowledge of the transition operation said Lucas was on a short list of about five names that are under consideration for the post, which has started to attract considerable interest from prominent “anti-conservation zealots.”\n\nIn a public hint of the rampant nepotism that Trump is planning to make official policy, they even said that the infamous cheetah killer, Trump’s self-entitled son Don Jr., is also in the running for Interior Secretary.\n\nThe Interior Ministry quite literally owns 28% of America’s land, manages our national parks and forests, the federal Fish & Wildlife Service, and also makes major decisions in the gambling industry because of its oversight of the commission that regulates tribal casinos. The Department of Interior holds massive sway over mineral extraction rights and leasing on public lands too, so the oil industry relies on it for decisions, regulations and pays rent to Uncle Sam through that government agency too.\n\nThe Sierra Club issued a stark warning about what Trump’s choice means for the country: “Putting an oil executive in charge of our public lands and precious coasts in places like North Carolina, Virginia and Florida is a virtual guarantee that Trump’s promise to throw open season on drilling in our special places will come true if he’s elected.”\n\nLucas is the kind of heartless swine who fought (and thankfully failed) to stop a voter ballot initiative that targeted cruel puppy mills in Missouri in 2010.\n\nIt’s scary to watch while Donald Trump dangles choices for a powerful appointed public office so outrageous it seems almost comical. If the only two choices are a reactionary oil company oligarch who will certainly plunder our nation’s natural bounty like a child in a candy shop and supports animal cruelty as a policy platform or the silver-spoon-fed self-entitled neo-Nazi misogynist scion who takes pleasure in slaughtering defenseless endangered animals with high-powered weapons, one might ask if this was a made-for-TV movie. But Donald Trump is very serious – as is the threat he poses to our country.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "Federal Prosecutors Accuse Chris Christie Of Masterminding Bridgegate (VIDEO)",
    "content": "Federal prosecutors began the first “Bridgegate” criminal trial by leveling their biggest accusations at New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, even though his two main deputies are the ones on trial this week. At least one known death was attributed to Bridgegate by the news media.\n\nEven though Christie isn’t a defendant in today’s court action, the stunning revelation from prosecutors means they may still see him as the ultimate target of their three year criminal investigation, as NJ.com reported:\n\nU.S. Attorney Vikas Khanna, describing the chaos of the traffic jams that paralyzed Fort Lee beginning on Sept. 9, 2013, said David Wildstein, a former Port Authority employee who plead guilty to federal charges last year, will admit he was the one who came up with that idea. The prosecutor added that Wildstein will testify he and Baroni told Christie about the scheme at the very moment traffic was at a standstill in Fort Lee during a Sept. 11 commemoration Manhattan. “The evidence will show that Baroni and Wildstein were so committed to their plan to punish Mayor Sokolich that during those precious few minutes that they had alone with the governor, they bragged about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned. This case is about the defendants abuse of power and their callous disregard for the people of Fort Lee,” said Khanna.\n\nLast year, Trump publicly accused Christie of knowing about Bridgegate, but after the former federal prosecutor knocked out Marco Rubio in a primary debate and pledged blind fealty to the orange-faced one, the two Republicans have become nearly inseparable, no doubt brought together over a mutual love of McDonald’s.\n\nFederal prosecutors are seeking to convict Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was Governor Christie’s deputy chief of staff. The only thing that the defense, prosecutors and all of the accused actually agree upon, is that the New Jersey Republican knew about his subordinates’ political retribution against a local mayor.\n\nIn fact, defense lawyers claim that the disruptive shutdown of the George Washington Bridge connecting Fort Lee to New York City now known as BridgeGate had to be covered up to protect Christie’s now tarnished political career, because even back in 2013 he was plotting a Presidential campaign:\n\nDefense lawyers have long argued that Mr. Christie, a Republican, and his top advisers were well aware of the lane closings and that they directed the cover-up as they tried to protect the governor’s political aspirations — saying their clients were “thrown under the presidential bus,” as one lawyer argued on Monday. But this was the first time a prosecutor had pointed a finger at Mr. Christie. And it directly contradicts the governor’s statements in the three years since the lanes were mysteriously closed, paralyzing the borough of Fort Lee, N.J. See Also Media Trump attacks yet another black female reporter. This time it’s MSNBC’s Joy Reid\n\nAs usual, the New York Times understates the forcefulness of Chris Christie’s prior defense of his blatant lies in BridgeGate. We uncovered this extraordinary video where the New Jersey Republican spent an astonishing two hours lying to the media in a televised press conference where he plainly claimed not to know anything.\n\nFor years, Christie has claimed that he got away with the crime of using his public office for political purposes to harm hundreds of thousands of New York and New Jersey residents stuck in massive traffic jams caused by his irresponsible Republican administration. From the sound of federal prosecutors, it appears that they simply waited until they had every other co-conspirator so firmly within their grasp to serve Christie notice, and he’s the most likely final target of this prosecution.\n\nWatch his shame:\n\nWhat do you think?",

W. Bush, who revealed to a Kennedy that it was time to go public in favor of the Democratic party’s candidate Hillary Clinton:\n\nBush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nThe Republican Party’s embrace of unrepentant racism under Trump is personally stinging to the Bush family after his sons Jeb Bush married women of Hispanic origins and learned Spanish. It’s no surprise that the eldest Bush of the bunch would declare early his vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nBoth of Texas’ major daily newspapers in Houston and Dallas, who are both deeply conservative news organizations, endorsed Hillary Clinton long before this year’s presidential debates, which kick off next week.\n\nIt must be reassuring to the elder statesman’s rare crossing of party lines, knowing that he can trust the depth of Hillary Clinton’s national security experience and that her relationships with foreign leaders is unmatched by any party’s nominee in possibly all of our nation’s history.\n\nFormer President George H.W. Bush won’t be the last prominent Republican to declare for Hillary Clinton in this year’s General Election, but he is one of the few whose judgement we can actually respect.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "ILLEGAL: Trump Stole $258,000 From His Non-Profit’s Donors To Settle For-Profit Lawsuits, Says Washington Post",
    "content": "A new investigation has determined that Donald Trump’s charitable foundation funneled other people’s money into settling his lawsuits, which violates laws preventing charitable organizations from accepting donors funds and benefitting those who run the foundations. With a stroke of the pen Trump pilfered the average wage of five working Americans to payoff his business fines:\n\nDonald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump’s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “self-dealing” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses.\n\nThe Washington Post‘s David Farenthold has doggedly chased down every lead from the Donald J. Trump Foundation and is in the process of singlehandedly using a dog-eared notebook (they’ve shown photos of it) to literally do what the entire news media is afraid of doing: a complete fact check of Donald Trump’s dubious history of illegal self-dealing and political corruption.\n\nIt was Farenthold’s investigation which has now caused every major newspaper in Florida to call for a federal investigation into the Trump University pay-for-play scandal where the very same foundation Trump robbed to payoff lawsuits also made an illegal campaign contribution to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nNow his reporting shows that he used the same foundation to settle a $120,000 fine for Mar-a-lago, Trump’s glitzy party palace in Palm Beach and the nation’s largest private home. Trump was supposed to donate money to a veteran’s foundation, instead he simply took it from others who donated to the foundation instead. Ironically, it was all because of the size of a flagpole:\n\nIn one case, from 2007, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole. In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines — if Trump’s club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people’s money, according to tax records.\n\nThis wasn’t just charity for the wealthy; it was a direct subsidy to one of the Trump Organization’s most prized businesses. But it wouldn’t be the only six figure heist engineered by Donald Trump with little more than the stroke of a pen. When you watch Donald Trump pitch his golf course in Scotland on a campaign trip, just remember that the mismanagement of his expensive golf courses frequently land the Republican nominee in court.\n\nWaPo reports that:\n\nOne of Trump’s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff’s chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records. See Also Politics Ocasio-Cortez finally let into detention camp, reports immigrants drinking from toilets\n\nOn top of that, Trump also used his charitable foundation’s funds to buy a 6-foot tall oil canvas painting of himself and a $12,000 Tim Tebow football helmet. The latest find by Farenthold uncovered that he spent another $10,000 on second portrait of himself as well as $5000 for advertisements for his chain of hotels. We hear that the latest of Trump’s charitable oil-on-canvas selfies is smaller.\n\nThe New York Attorney General has already opened an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation for its illegal transaction with Florida’s Attorney General, and these new revelations appear to fit right in with the pattern of the Republican’s nominee for President which we know all too well by now. Donald Trump is all too happy to lie or cheat or steal, as long as he can get away with it.\n\nHere’s the check proving that Trump stole from his donors to pay for Mar-a-lago’s debts:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "HORROR: In The 90’s, Trump Kept Hitler’s Speeches By His Bedside",
    "content": "After an exhausting day of ruining the lives of everyday Americans, rumor has it Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likes to curl up in his gold-plated bed and relax with a book by his favorite author – Adolf Hitler.\n\nLong before Trump began his run for president where racism, bigotry, hatred, division, and fear became the pillars of his campaign he was studying the work of man who is responsible for the third-most murders in human history. According to a 1990 Vanity Fair article written by Marie Brenner, Trump’s ex-wife Ivana, spilled the beans on Trump’s love affair with Hitler:\n\nIvana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist.\n\nWhen the pathologically lying Trump was confronted about owning the book he feigned ignorance. The interviewer asked him, “Did your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?” Trump was shocked and attempted to deflect the question by asking a question, “Who told you that?” but he then confirmed he owned the book, “Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of “Mein Kampf”, and he’s a Jew.”\n\nThat Trump would even admit to owning the book is bad enough, but his justification for owning the book offers a window into his contorted carnival house of mirrors logic. Trump reasons it’s okay to read about Hitler hating Jews, because his Jewish friend gifted it to him, and wouldn’t it be rude to discard the gift without giving it a thorough read?\n\nTrump lied about lying, as is his standard fare. Marty Davis did indeed confirm giving Trump the book, but it was Hitler’s “My Jewish Order” not “Mein Kampf.” Whether or not that is worse is up for debate. Davis went on to say he isn’t Jewish, but that he and Trump are friends.\n\nThen, likely after realizing he had outed himself as xenophobic towards Jewish people, Trump back peddled claiming even if he had Hitler’s book he wouldn’t read it. Trump said, “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.” What does he mean he’s not saying he has the speeches? He literally confirmed he had them moments earlier!\n\nWhile it is an exercise in one’s gag reflex to picture Trump in bed, it is natural to picture him with a Nazi swastika draped over his headboard, while filling his brain with strategies to bamboozle and terrorize the public. Trump’s campaign has been ripped from Hitler’s playbook of demonizing minorities and blaming them for the ills of a nation, which is all the more reason why Trump must be prevented from winning the presidency in less than seven weeks. If Trump has been studying Hitler for almost 30 years it is too generous of a leap to believe Trump was only interested in Hitler’s rise to power, and in fact will continue to crib Hitler’s strategies if and when he assumes power himself.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "JUST IN: Man Screams “There You Go, Muslim!” As He Throws Firebomb Into Car",
    "content": "In yet another of the disturbing Islamophobic attacks occuring more and more frequently in the United States, a man in northern Philadelphia (Dauphin and Cleveland streets) is wanted for throwing a firebomb into an occupied car. The assailant allegedly screamed “there you go, Muslim!” as he hurled what is assumed to be an improvised incendiary device into the vehicle.\n\nThe victim was rushed to the hospital and is being treated for severe burns.\n\nThe fearmongering rhetoric of Donald Trump and the far-right wing has lead to an appalling uptick in anti-Muslim attacks, the frequency of which increased by a staggering 87.5% after Republican nominee Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nSuch heinous attacks only serve to divide us and make us less safe. It intensifies the perception that Muslims are not welcome in the United States, and it is precisely that kind of alienation that creates fertile ground for predatory radicals to work their pernicious evil. Jihadi propaganda relies on the central argument that Western “crusader” culture despises Muslims and that Islamic culture is incompatible with the West; these kind of attacks only prove their point.\n\nThat’s why Donald Trump has been featured in recruitment videos from brutal jihadi groups like Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) and Somalia’s al-Shabaab. Former CIA director Michael Hayden explained that “When Mr. Trump says some of the things that he has said — ‘they all hate us,’ ‘we shouldn’t let any of those people in our country’ — what he does is underscore and underpin the fundamentals of [the ISIS] narrative of undying enmity. We don’t have radicalized communities in the United States. We have some radicalized individuals, but we have it fully within our ability to create radicalized communities, and that kind of rhetoric … actually bends you in the direction of radicalizing communities.”\n\nUnless we want the plague of terrorism to spread in the United States, we must be inclusionary and accepting, manifesting the values of tolerance and pluralism that our country was founded on. We cannot allow the rabble-rousing ramblings of a bigot to put the lives of our citizens in danger.\n\nPolice are still searching for a suspect.\n\nHere’s a video of the aftermath, courtesy of @FeministaJones:\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "Multiple Witnesses: Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head",
    "content": "Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.\n\nOne key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/maxberger/status/778814400568233984\n\nWe interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:\n\nI watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\n“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\n“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”\n\n“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”\n\nFive minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.\n\n“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’\n\nCNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”\n\nThe City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:\n\nALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016\n\nTwo additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.\n\n“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”\n\nLastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”\n\nWhen African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.\n\nOriginal story by Grant Stern at PINAC News: “WITNESS: Charlotte Riot Police Did Shoot Protester, Deny Involvement Blaming Civilians“\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump’s latest escapade has been to swindle $1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him, according to FEC filings.\n\nThe Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate.\n\nTypically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service, and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds. However, Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by, TAG Air, Inc, one of his companies. Therefore, the Secret Service – and the American taxpayer- are literally paying Trump.\n\nThis is in sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton’s campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways, to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement. One’s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her travel, but selective outrage is their stock and trade.\n\nTrump’s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they’ve done. A spokeswoman of Trump’s campaign, Hope Hicks, said, “Everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.”\n\nAlong with Secret Service payments, Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons. It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels, as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible. This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "BOMBSHELL: ABC Reveals Trump Paid “Hundreds Of Millions” By Russian Oligarchs",
    "content": "Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.\n\nThroughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.\n\nAn ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.\n\nTrump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”\n\nThe oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.\n\n“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?\n\nWhen the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.\n\nThese business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.\n\nWatch ABC News’ report here:\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "BREAKING: New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over “Bridgegate”",
    "content": "New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:\n\nThe decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.\n\nChris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.\n\nJust four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.\n\nGovernor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.\n\nFamously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.\n\nLast week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.\n\nThe Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.\n\nWatch his shame:\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "JUST IN: Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony",
    "content": "During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:\n\nOne of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.\n\nAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.\n\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:\n\nNow consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\n\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\n\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.\n\nTrump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\n\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:\n\nBush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people. See Also Politics Ukraine’s ex-president wrecks Trump’s Biden narrative: He never asked me to close cases\n\nTranscript of 2007 Trial Deposition:\n\nA lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "JUST IN: U.S. Officials Investigating Trump Campaign’s Secret Ties To Putin’s Kremlin",
    "content": "Congressional leaders and intelligence officials are investigating whether one of Donald Trump’s foreign policy “advisers” has opened up private communications with high-level members of the Russian government, some of whom are under sanction. According to multiple sources the talks have discussed the possibility that a Trump administration would lift the economic sanctions that were imposed on Russia after its unilateral annexation of Crimea in 2014, an international crime that Trump has refused to even acknowledge.\n\nThe Trump adviser, Carter Page, is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York-based consulting firm, Global Energy Capital, that specializes in oil and gas deals with Russia and is located around the block from Trump’s office in New York. Page was first identified by Mr. Trump in March as a member of his “foreign policy team,” which is a motley crew of neoconservative oil men, Lebanese fascists, and imperial proconsuls from Iraq. He has since become one of Trump’s most prominent foreign policy spokesmen, although the campaign maintains that he is not officially on the bankroll.\n\nPage has extensive financial interests in Russia, notably in Gazprom, the state-run oil and gas giant, and Rosneft, the nation’s leading private oil company. He has frequently visited Moscow for meetings with high-level officials at the Kremlin and in Rosneft, and has been “a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did” according to a U.S. diplomat in Russia. Under particular scrutiny is Page’s trip to Moscow this July, when he met with Igor Sechin, a long-time Putin adviser and former deputy Prime Minister who is now the head of Rosneft and is currently under sanction by the United States government.\n\nAccording to numerous US officials in Moscow, Page discussed with Sechin ways to lift the American sanctions, a cause that is close to Page’s heart – and his wallet. Last March he told Bloomberg News that “so many people I work with have been adversely affected by the sanctions policy” and said that there was “a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation.” On that summer trip Page reportedly also met with Igor Devykin, the Kremlin’s deputy chief of internal policy who is believed by U.S. officials to be the official responsible for Russia’s campaign of meddling in the American election.\n\nIndeed the original impetus for investigating Page came from the Congressional investigation into Russia’s cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and on voter databases in Arizona and Illinois. While the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees have “concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election” that “could only come from senior levels of the Russian government,” Trump’s usual chauvinistic bravado has been totally absent in the face of this unprecedented meddling in American democracy by a foreign power. Indeed he has denied that Russia was even responsible.\n\nTrump’s evasiveness on the issue is part of a long pattern of scandalous pandering to the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, from calling him a “better leader” than President Obama to promising to hand over the Baltic States to the Kremlin and going on Russian state TV to criticize American foreign policy.\n\nTrump’s traitorous appeasement of Putin, and the shocking monetary ties between his campaign and the inner circle of Russian oligarchs have already received some scrutiny – albeit far less than they should – in the American press. In Carter Page’s Moscow meetings, however, we may finally have the smoking gun implicating Trump’s campaign – or at least those close to him – in a traitorous plot with the despotic Russian government. The bombshell revelations that show Trump has received “hundreds of millions” of dollars from Russian oligarchs makes it clear why both sides would be interested in repealing the sanctions.\n\nCould Russia be plotting with Trump’s associates to influence the election in favor of the Donald, placing a Kremlin lackey in the White House who will lift sanctions in exchange for an economic windfall for his neoconservative cronies? Why else would his top foreign policy adviser promise a blacklisted Kremlin official to do what he can to end the sanctions and meet with the Russian intelligence official specifically tasked with influencing the American election?\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "To cap off a week in which police officers shot and killed two unarmed black men, a Georgia police officer has been arrested after it was discovered that she had fabricated a story about being shot by black man. Jackson Officer Sherry Hall has been charged with “false statements, tampering, interference with government property and a violation of oath of office.”\n\n“After following leads and evidence, the investigation has now revealed that there is no, and never was, a suspect shooter at large in Jackson, Georgia” announced special agent Joe Wooten, who was investigating the “case.” Hall reported that on September 13th, a black man had shot her in her bulletproof vest, but it was discovered that the entire thing – radio call, tear in shirt, spent shell – was all a set-up.\n\nThe story is a stark reminder that the word of the police cannot always be taken at face value. When a protester was shot in the head during the Charlotte riots, the police immediately announced it was a civilian-on-civilian shooting, but multiple eyewitness reports say that it was a rubber bullet fired by riot police. A picture emerged of recently slain disabled black man Keith Lamont Scott showing a gun on the ground – but the video released by his grieving wife shows no gun but instead shows a cop dropping his glove. A police officer in St. Louis, Missouri, was recently charged with a homicide after it was discovered he had shot and killed a black man and then planted a gun on his body to justify his murder.\n\nIn an increasingly post-truth political atmosphere, we must demand and receive evidence. We cannot rely on the word of anybody – our politicians or police officers.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Bloomberg News will become the first ever 24 hour cable news television network to live broadcast a presidential debate with live, in-screen fact checking tonight. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton released a 19 page fact-check in advance of tonight’s debate listing the many lies and false bromides spread by her opponent.\n\nConsidering that Republican nominee Donald Trump averages one lie per 3.5 minutes of public statements, their graphics and fact check teams will be working overtime, according to Politico:\n\nBloomberg TV will conduct on-screen fact checks of statements made by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during Monday night’s debate, POLITICO has confirmed. The channel’s decision to conduct an on-screen fact-check sets Bloomberg apart from the other major TV networks, none of whom have committed to doing on-screen fact checks during the debate. Most will leave the fact-checking to segments in the post-debate analysis coverage.\n\nNPR is also planning an aggressive fact checking strategy in their online news offerings, and all of the networks plan to check facts after the candidates leave the stage, but in this extraordinary election there’s no better time than when 100 million Americans and people around the world watching live.\n\nBloomberg News is setting an exemplary standard which NBC News has refused to emulate. NBC host Lester Holt, a registered Republican, will moderate tonight’s event.\n\nHopefully, all of the major broadcast news networks will make the effort to upgrade their fact checking teams in time for the last two debates, one of which moderated by Fox News’ Chris Wallace has already been announced as a fact-free debate.\n\nFacts don’t matter much to Republican voters or Trump supporters, but to the moderates and independents who don’t know what policies are at stake in this year’s election, they’re very important, and should be what they base their voting decisions upon.\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump will only share a stage tonight and for two other nights – if all goes as planned with the next two debates – so there’s limited time to disseminate what’s factual versus what isn’t to American voters immediately while attention is on the truth. Unless we want this election to truly usher in a “post-truth” era where information is accepted regardless of its relation to reality, we must hold Donald Trump to the truth. We cannot allow him to lie to the American people any longer.\n\nTonight’s debate begins at 9pm. You can click here to watch online.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "Trump Said “Obama’s” Chicago’s Crime Rate Has Exploded. It’s Gone DOWN",
    "content": "Trump repeated tonight one of his favorite fear-mongering lies: that crime is dangerously out of control in American cities. Specifically, he cited Chicago – which he emphasized is “Obama’s hometown” – as an example of a place plagued by out of control crime. In reality, however, crime rates in all categories have been consistently declining over the past decade and a half – albeit with a recent almost statistically insignificant spike in murder in some select cities.\n\nAs for Chicago, crime – both violent and otherwise – has been consistently declining since about 2001. There has indeed been a spike in homicides over the past few years, but even this year’s exceptional murder count will not exceed the almost 700 murders tallied in the early Bush years, much less the almost one thousand annual murders in the 1990s. In fact, the annual murder and violent crime rate in Chicago under President Obama has been lower than any other time in decades.\n\nThe decrease in crime in Chicago corresponds with nationwide trends. Since the 1990s violent crime in all areas and all categories has declined tremendously. There has indeed been a recent uptick in murders in a few cities but the overall trend remains incontrovertible downward. That’s just the facts. These facts, however, don’t sit well with a demagogic fearmonger like Donald Trump, who relies on fear and hatred to mobilize his support. In the midst of tonight’s debate Trump even deployed the archetypal line of the dictator-to-be: “we need law and order.” And Trump is not going to let the facts get in the way of his delusional plots.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Whether it was crime, national security, the economy, trade, or his own tax returns, Trump was on the defensive the entire night, unable to overcome the consequences of his own selfish decisions and the weaknesses of the incoherent rambles that pass for policy positions for the Republican nominee.\n\nImmediately after the debate, Trump rolled out a pathetic excuse for his own failures tonight.\n\nTrump is relentlessly sticking to this ridiculous notion that the system is “rigged” against him, refusing to admit that he’s shot himself in the foot so many times that the vast majority of the American people will be unwilling to support a rabble-rousing racist with an extensive history of shady business practices. Not only is it a shameful refusal to admit his own mistakes, but it’s an existential attack on our entire democracy.\n\nHis mic was clearly not defective, since he continuously interrupted both moderator Lester Holt and Secretary Clinton tonight and didn’t back down off from failed attempts to take cheap shots at the Democratic nominee. His childish behavior tonight illustrates that he is temperamentally unfit to be the President of the United States, and this pitiful response is just the cherry on the cake.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Bloomberg News reports that the Mexican peso grew significantly stronger after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s powerful performance in tonight’s key first presidential debate, after confidently besting Republican Donald Trump. The “invisible hand” of the market is predicting a Hillary Clinton win after tonight’s debate, and that she’s the only one of the two candidates whose election would keep more jobs in the USA too:\n\nThe Mexican peso rebounded from a record low, a sign investors may perceive Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in the first U.S. presidential debate. The currency rose 2 percent to 19.4879 per dollar as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest gain across more than 140 currencies worldwide, after the debate concluded.\n\nAround the world, currency traders, the kind-of-by-the-numbers, bottom line capitalists who Republicans profess to believe in the most, were unequivocal. They awarded victory in the first 2016 Presidential debate to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by buying up Mexican pesos believing them to be more valuable with a stable diplomatic situation, and by the numbers traders weighed in:\n\n“I shall not speculate on whether Clinton won or was Trumped,” wrote Jeffrey Halley wrote market strategist at Oanda Corporation in Singapore, “But clearly, the highest [correlated] currency to a Trump victory thinks she did!”\n\nOn a practical level, a stronger Peso also means that labor in Mexico will get more expensive for American companies as the exchange rate moves when Hillary does better in polling. Professional currency traders have been betting against the Mexican currency for months to insure themselves against an improbable Republican victory in November, which would set forth a catastrophe if NAFTA is unilaterally cancelled, costing millions of Americans their jobs to appease Trump’s delirious policy dreams.\n\nIronically, this means that a Trump victory would make outsourcing far more attractive since people would depress the value of Mexican pesos, making the cost of hiring even cheaper than today.\n\nThis also means that a Hillary Clinton victory in November will make Mexico’s currency stronger, which will in turn make it more attractive to our corporations to hire American workers or slow down the rate of outsourcing because of higher labor costs south of the border with a stronger Peso.\n\nVoting for Hillary Clinton is now economically certain to be better than voting for her lying Republican opponent, because his racism would literally be self-defeating, and the “invisible hand of the market” would be best held by a Democrat’s steady hand in the Oval Office come January.\n\nWhat do you think?",

He cited former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s unconstitutional and discriminatory “stop-and-frisk” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers.\n\nBut his account didn’t match up with the facts, and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the NYPD isn’t good at their jobs. The Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information of the NYPD, J. Peter Donald, fact-checked Trump during the debate, and has this to say about the racist Republican’s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by Mayor Bloomberg in 2011:\n\n\n\nTrump is trying to position himself as “tough on crime” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers. Not only was “stop-and-frisk” ineffective, it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended, crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques. Trump is trying to sell the American people an apocalyptic vision of America that just doesn’t exist – and the policemen whose support he’s courting aren’t buying it either.\n\nWhat do you think?",

CNN’s David Chalian emphasized on air that the sample was 10 points more Democratic than in a typical poll, but that’s still a strong win for Clinton.\n\nA poll of debate watchers by Public Policy Polling, which found that 51 percent thought Clinton won and 40 percent thought Trump won.\n\nA focus group of 20 undecided Florida voters by CNN found that 18 of them thought Clinton won.\n\nAnd a focus group of Pennsylvania voters by GOP pollster Frank Luntz overwhelmingly thought Clinton had won. Libby Nelson has more details about that here.\n\nThat tremendous advantage for Clinton is crucial, given that some 50% of likely voters have said that the debates will help inform their decision. Facts, experience, and respect clearly matter to the voters, and last night’s debate showed once again that all three are on the side of Mrs. Clinton.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "BREAKING: Putin’s Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won",
    "content": "Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.\n\nThe #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016\n\nWhat’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:\n\nData is from Trendsmap.com\n\nThat’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.\n\nPutin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”\n\nSo remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently featured former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, Between Two Ferns. Previously, he’s interviewed President Obama as well as other celebrities like Brad Pitt and Justin Beiber, but there’s one person he refuses to have on the show.\n\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Galifianakis was asked if he would have Republican nominee Donald Trump on his show since his interview with Clinton was such a resounding success – and his answer is hilarious. “No. That doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way doesn’t interest me. He’s the kind of guy who likes attention – bad attention or good attention. So you’re dealing with a psychosis there that’s a little weird. I wouldn’t have somebody on that’s so mentally challenged. I feel like I’d be taking advantage of him. And you can print that.”\n\nBetween Two Ferns is known for its exceptionally awkward dialogue and for the host’s fondness for asking uncomfortable questions (he once asked Pres. Obama “How does it feel to know you’re going to be the last black president?”). Part of the joke is both parties attempting to maintain their composure and not rising to the bait.\n\nJudging from the way that Donald Trump lashes out like a wounded animal at the slightest provocation and is utterly incapable of letting the pettiest slight go without a response, it’s safe to say that Galifinakis is right about how Trump would fare on his show. But it’s terrifying to think that a man who couldn’t handle being on a comedy interview show has a real shot at ascending to the presidency of the United States; he has shown time and time again that he is temperamentally unfit for the office.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Turns out the online polls being re-tweeted all over Twitter by Trump supporters and the presidential candidate himself are not organic, but part of an elaborate campaign created to manipulate the polling and fool the public into thinking that the debate was a Trump victory after-the-fact.\n\nHere’s Trump’s tweet with all his fictitious accolades:\n\nTuesday morning after the first televised presidential debate, a mysterious #TrumpWon hashtag emerged from the Russian troll-farms in St. Petersberg that started trending along with dubious online polls saying Trump had won the debate.\n\nThe hashtag ran contrary to the popular opinion reflected in every major media news network poll, which showed Hilary Clinton as the clear winner of the night. Even conservative TV network Fox News conceded this point when attracting attention to the polls saying, “if polls only included media pundits, Hillary Clinton would have won Monday’s debate by a landslide.”\n\nThing is, Hilary did win the debate by a landslide, even if the online polls didn’t accurately reflect that. And thanks to The Daily Dot, we now know the reason why Trump won the online polls but literally lost by every other yardstick:\n\nIt’s because Trump supporters cheated.\n\nThe effort to create a false narrative of a Trump debate victory began by recruiting members of the pro-Trump Reddit community r/The_Donald and 4chan message boards, affecting somewhere around 70 polls, including polls by Time, Fortune, and CNBC. The r/The_Donald community has over 200,000 subscribers, and with its numbers it made short work of online polls susceptible to bots, vote brigading, and other forms of manipulation that make these online survey results extremely dubious.\n\nThis latest instance of foul play from the Trump campaign tells us the length to which Trump supporters will go to get their candidate elected, especially if they see it as their only recourse. Luckily nothing could be done for Donald, because his loss was so dramatically obvious, that tampering with the polls wasn’t enough to hide the glaring fact that he lost.\n\nLet’s hope that next November, manipulating online polls won’t be enough to stop the critical mass of reasonable voters who don’t want to elect a megalomaniac.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "BREAKING: Republicans Move To Shut Down Government For A Sick Reason",
    "content": "The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded as Mitch McConnell and other Republicans insisted on keeping corporate political funding hidden from voters and denying aid to the beleaguered residents of Flint, MI. Senators have been working in recent days on hammering out a short-term funding bill known as a continuing resolution that would fund the government until December 9 at the least. Absent such an agreement, the federal government will run out of money and shut down in three days on October 1.\n\nThe intransigence of Senate Republicans on the issues of corporate financing and aid to Flint, however, have prevented the bill from passing as the Senate shot down a GOP continuing resolution today by a 55-45 vote. The first sticking point is a rider that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted on adding to the bill and which would block the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) from requiring publicly-traded corporations to disclose their political spending.\n\nEver since the Citizens United decision of 2010, corporate donors have been able to make unlimited political donations without disclosing any information on their political spending to the public. This has led to an unprecedented influx of corporate and big donor money in American elections – close to $700 million so far this year – and has served Republicans and their big-money donors quite well. So well, in fact, that Senate Republicans are willing to sacrifice the functioning of the government itself just to be able to keep the nefarious sources of their campaign financing secret and please the oligarchs who pull their strings.\n\nClashes have also arisen over Republican refusal to include in the bill aid to the city of Flint, MI, which is still suffering from the effects of a neoconservative-engineered lead poisoning crisis. The bill already includes flood aid for flood victims in Maryland, West Virginia, and Louisiana, and Democrats have requested that aid for the victims of the water crisis in Flint be included as well. Republicans, however, have refused to add this money, and have come up with a variety of facetious justifications for their indifference to the sufferings of poor African-Americans, from claiming that the Flint crisis is a local issue to deciding that the Flint aid should be included in the separate Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) instead.\n\nThe problem with that excuse is that Democrats have already tried to pass the Flint aid through WRDA but came up against the same wall of Republican intransigence and indifference there. The Senate successfully passed a version of the WRDA earlier this year that included more than $220 million in aid and infrastructure improvements for Flint. Paul Ryan and his band of extremist Republicans in the House, however, stripped the Flint aid provision from the House version of the WRDA, and the discrepancy between the bills would have to be settled in conference committee negotiations after the November election, and the dominance of hardline Republicans in the House makes it very unlikely that such a settlement would include aid to Flint.\n\nSo, once again, Republicans, for whom compromise and good governance seem to be alien concepts, are sending the federal government hurtling down the path to shutdown for absolutely no good reason. The issues underlying this most recent case of intransigence, however, demonstrate more clearly than ever the degree to which many Republicans have ceased to serve the people they are elected to protect and instead devote all of their efforts to aiding their corporate sponsors. If the health and livelihood of this nation’s oppressed minorities have to be sacrificed in the process, these Republicans won’t bat an eye.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "headline": "JUST IN: Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination",
    "content": "S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\n“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhat do you think?",

After the bomb went off, social media blew up with proud jihadist sympathizers scoring one for their team.\n\nSome of the comments on social media were as follows;\n\n“The lions of the Caliphate roar in New York, we cause you pain inside your house, the carrier of the Cross,” wrote one Twitter user who went by the name “I am ISIS, come and block me.” The account was soon suspended. Another, called “The Lone Wolves,” tweeted with the Arabic hashtag #ExplosionManhattanNewYork “Oh God burn America, take revenge in the name of your oppressed slaves and believers’ blood.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nOthers tweeted about “good tidings that keep coming” from New York, and one user affiliated with al-Qaeda in Syria tweeted: “Oh God go against America, the head of infidels. Oh God, count them and kill them one by one, and do not spare anyone of them.”\n\nEvil walks this earth. It’s name is radical Islamic terrorism. It celebrates when the blood of infidels (meaning regular people who do not agree with radical Islam) is spilled. It laughs with glee when New York is terrorized. It mocks westerners, Americans, Christians and Jews. It cares nothing for pain, suffering and outrage. It wishes and works for the day that Islam dominates the earth.\n\nThat evil prowls social media taking credit for and celebrating bloodshed.\n\nAnd this newest event is no exception. There is joy among jihadists as New Yorkers and Minnesotans lie in their own blood. They need to be stopped. But who will do it?\n\nSee video of explosion below.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Note In Arabic Found With NYC Bomb… Call Says There Will Be More Bombings\n\nPolice have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.\n\nPolice are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:\n\nLead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nLead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”\n\nLead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.\n\nManufacturing Test Explosives\n\nHi. You probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in New York City, that was me. Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.\n\nSomeone is lying and it’s just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn’t even do it. Trying to benefit off of other’s terror is as base as you can go next to being the perpetrator.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

As expected, the two candidates running for office gave their comments on the matter..\n\nBut it was only one that really caught the attention of the media and not for what was said, but rather how it was delivered.\n\nHillary Clinton used her response to a New York City bombing Saturday night to yet again take a swing at Donald Trump, but opponents and the media wondered if she was swinging while she was under the influence of something else.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nA tranquilized-sounding Clinton looked as if she was dazed out of her mind, as well as looking as if she was about to drop over and fall asleep.\n\nShe spoke with the media pool that have been following her around on the campaign:\n\n“I’ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey and the attack in Minnesota. Obviously we need to do everything we can to support our first responders, I’ll have more to say about it when we actually know some facts.”\n\nAs she was giving her take, a reporter asked about Donald Trump’s reply and if she had any further comment on it.\n\n“I think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this. That’s why it’s critical to support the first responders, the investigators who are looking into it trying to determine what did happen. I think it’s also wiser to wait until you have information before making conclusions because we are just in the beginning stages of trying to determine what happened,” she said.\n\nTwitter has gone crazy over the interview, with many followers saying they believed Clinton was either drugged up, or she just didn’t have the energy to wake herself up in a time of need.\n\nEither, or – it’s not Presidential material.\n\nIs she highly medicated or what??

    "content": "Clinton’s Response To “Hillary For Prison”?! “Let’s Make It Happen!” [VIDEO]\n\nHillary just gets punked over and over again these days. Her latest embarrassment came at a rally where some guy yelled, “Hillary for prison!” To which Hillary replied, “Let’s make it happen!” The entire nation finally agrees with Hillary Clinton on something. But I’m sure she got confused (yet again) and didn’t mean to say that. She must have misheard the guy and thought that he said something like, “Hillary for president!” Funny and pathetic all at once.\n\nNot to be outdone, Elizabeth Warren posed for a selfie with someone she thought was a Hillary supporter… not so much. She got punked as well with the young man saying, “But you lied about your ethnicity!” He also said Hillary would lose to Trump which caused a back and forth. That just made it worse for Warren. Cringeworthingly humiliating.\n\nFrom InfoWars:\n\nHillary Clinton was caught in an embarrassing moment when someone at her rally yelled “Hillary for prison!”, to which the presidential candidate responded, “Let’s make it happen!” Trending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet The cringeworthy moment was captured on film. Given her now notorious propensity for being constantly “confused,” Hillary probably thought the man was saying “Hillary for president!,” but nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThe “Hillary for prison!” meme has been going on now for some time. Born out of a frustration that she has not been held accountable for even the slightest of her crimes, the slogan reflects the mood of America. And Trump has capitalized on it brilliantly.\n\n‘Hillary for Prison 2016’ has become the theme of the Grand Old Party – Americans see what the Hildabeast is… the most corrupt politician to ever run for office in our country. Since the GOP convention, it has been the rallying cry of those who support Donald Trump and even those who don’t. Hillary’s own associates and friends say that she is corrupt beyond belief.\n\nBetween the scandals plaguing Clinton and her severe health issues, Trump is now leading her in the polls. And with the renewed terrorism threats and the support of the police union, Trump is sure to surge even further ahead. Clinton looks frail, weak and tainted… if the country is besieged by terrorist attack after attack, they will turn to a strongman like Donald Trump and beg for his leadership. God help us.\n\nAmerica is changing and not for the better. Be careful what you wish for, you may just get it.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Secret Video Records MASSIVE Hillary Event Flop!\n\nSoooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.\n\nI watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.\n\nFrom Gateway Pundit:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. In fact, the only Hillary supporters at the offices were the staff running the headquarters. When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.\n\nThe staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.\n\nThe Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.\n\nHillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.\n\nBetween Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Court OK with Muslim Man Kicking Woman in Face for Wearing Shorts [VIDEO]\n\nSharia law is one of the greatest evils of mankind and women are overwhelmingly the subject of this evil. Yet somehow, so-called “feminists” turn a completely blind eye to it. Women can be oppressed and victimized with not even a peep about the injustice of it all. The latest example that will surely not bother today’s feminists comes out of Turkey, where a woman was kicked in the face by a man for committing the crime of wearing shorts. The kicker is that a Turkish court declared that he had done nothing wrong.\n\n23 year-old Ayşegül Terzi works as a nurse in Istanbul and she was riding a bus when her attire caused a Muslim man on board to fly into a rage. So, he did what comes naturally — for Muslim men who follow Sharia law anyway. He violently attacked her, kicking her in the face while screaming, “Those wearing shorts must die!”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThree other men tried to step in and stop the attack. The entire brouhaha was also caught on camera. The 35 year-old man responsible was caught and he confessed to everything. He admitted to police that he attacked the woman, saying, “The shorts she was wearing were not appropriate. That’s why I was angry and behaved so.”\n\nInsanely, the Turkish court agreed with him. He was released when the court found that he had done nothing wrong. And while American pretend feminists couldn’t care less about the plight of Turkish women who live in fear and oppression, actual feminists in Turkey have been speaking out about the violence against women. Hundreds of women are killed every year, many times by their husbands.\n\nBut of course, why should anyone worry about things like spontaneous violent attacks because of the clothes women are wearing, or the systemic abuse and even murder of wives by their husbands? Clearly, that’s not real oppression. Real oppression is what women in the United States go through, because they have to wait a day or two before they can get an abortion and they have to pay for it themselves. And sometimes, on college campuses, people say things that women don’t like. Why is everyone so worried about Muslim women when it’s American women that have the real problems… right, feminists?\n\nThis is why modern feminism is such a joke. These harpies whine about utterly inconsequential garbage, while actual women are suffering. They should really be ashamed.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Falconer is a former police chief of the Albany Police Department, where he still works part-time.

Watch …\n\nHillarys bleackbit specialist Paul Combetta deleting all of his reddit posts on video. @Lauren_Southern @Cernovichhttps://t.co/KZ9trBVpys — Erik Jones (@SMOKeMON_TRAINR) September 19, 2016\n\nHillary’s IT guy made the post on July 24, 2014 and can be read in it’s entirety below:\n\n[July 24, 2014] Hello all- I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out. I am not sure if something like this is possible with PowerShell, or exporting all of the emails to MSG and doing find/replaces with a batch processing program of some sort. Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?\n\nIt’s important to note the date, which was within 24 hours of a recent New York Post report that showed Combetta at that time trying to ship archived data to Clinton Executive Services Corp., or CESC, which handles logistics for Hillary and Bill Clinton.\n\nWas this the same data he was trying to forge or strip of evidence?\n\nCombetta would eventually delete the archive of Clinton emails and scrub them from the server, knowing full-well the House Committee on Benghazi had requested retention of the information.\n\nCombetta has reportedly been given immunity by the Obama Justice Department and was not charged.\n\nRead this Next on ThePoliticalInsider.com Rose McGowan Slams Hillary for Ignoring Alleged Victims of Sexual Assault\n\nComment: Is this the smoking gun of intent that FBI Director James Comey said he couldn’t find in allowing Hillary to avoid indictment?

    "content": "Migrant Reveals Sick Reason He Left…’to F*ck the Women’\n\nHarassment is known in Arabic as ‘taharrush’. Mass sexual assault of women in public has been documented in Egypt since 2005 and they recently began calling it the game of ‘taharrush’. Muslim men rape and assault women in public while hiding under protective cover of large gatherings. The Muslim men feel it’s their right because of the misogynistic ideology that women shouldn’t be leaving the house alone and deserve to be shamed using sexual violence. Assailants will create multiple rings around the woman to keep out anyone who tries to rescue them. It’s a really sick practice and women experiencing it could be groped, stripped, beaten, bitten, penetrated with fingers and raped. These Muslim gang rapes have grown and spread since 2012 when large protests in Egypt took place punishing women for attending such protests.\n\nSo, it stands to reason that a mass flood of Muslim men who feel that the taharrush of women is okay into Western countries would result in lots of gang rape. This particular story is of an illegal Algerian immigrant who beat a woman unconscious in an attempted rape, who was arrested and explained to the judge what he was doing in Austria. He told the court that he came to Australia to “f*ck the women.” Based on his actions and his previous convictions across Europe, he most likely means to rape women as is the custom of some young Muslim men.\n\nAfter the gang rape, the woman was left lying unconscious in bushes near the bus stop. She had some serious injuries and is considered to be psychologically scarred permanently. Luckily, she found a student who helped her. That student testified that, “The woman came up to me and was covered in blood. You could not see her face. She said to me: ‘I was raped.’”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThis wave of sexual assaults in Austria and Europe is only going to increase as the migrant population swells.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "New York bomb Suspect SUED Police!\n\nNow we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. The lawsuit says that the police had a ‘reckless disregard and deliberate indifference for plaintiff’s constitutional rights of liberty, due process and equal protection’. The Elizabeth police department allegedly ’embarked on a course to harass, humiliate, retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm’. The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘too much crime around here’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘known for criminal activity’.\n\nThe irony of it all is that just 5 years later, Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting. Hmmm, it’s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years, right? I’m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it’s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he’s been planning this for some time.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Bill Clinton’s Ex-Lover And Friend Makes Bold Claim About Hillary’s Health!\n\nBill Clinton has a slew of ex-girlfriends who I’m sure want to take a shot at Hillary, but one of them is actually doing it. Once you listen to what he has to say about Mrs. Clinton and the reason she believes Hillary is having suddenly noticeable health problems, you’re going to find yourself agreeing.\n\nDolly Kyle, who I had never heard of before right now, is the author of Hillary: The Other Woman and has a long, sordid past with the Former President of the United States Bill Clinton. The book details some horrible interactions with the Clintons, including a situation where Hillary actually blew up at a group of handicapped children while serving as the First Lady of Arkansas.\n\nKyle may have hit the nail on the head with her keen analysis of the Hillary Clinton health issue.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet “I really think she has been ’cruisin’ for a bruisin’, as we say in the South, because she’s such an angry person and so driven by this inner rage,” said Kyle. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”\n\nBut, she asserts, Hillary’s “inability to keep her lies straight” is not necessarily attributed to her anger, but “cognitive impairment.” I can’t say that I disagree.\n\nI’ve known several people who are just hateful and angry and they have a tendency to suffer from more physical ailments than the rest of us. Of course this isn’t going to be true of all people, but I have personally noticed a correlation between angry people and mental issues.\n\nBut Kyle says that anger is not the only strong emotion Clinton feels.\n\n“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” warned Kyle. “I call her ‘Hillary Scissorhands’ because of her predilection for destroying records which could get in the way of her goals.”\n\nI recommend buying Dolly’s book if you don’t already have it, because it is a disturbingly deep look into the behaviors of a woman who may very well become the next President of the United States. And with so many people, including former Secret Service agents, telling stories similar to the ones that Kyle has written about, there has to be some measure of truth to them.\n\nDo you think that Clinton’s health issues may be related to her behavior and attitude as a person?

    "content": "Obama’s Speech In New York Shocks Americans When He Says THIS About Attacks!\n\nI would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.\n\nHe has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.\n\nI’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nWhile you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.\n\nSurely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.\n\nWell apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.\n\nAre you outraged yet?\n\nIt gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.\n\nHe bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.\n\nCritics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.\n\nBut no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that. Disgusting.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Hillary Clinton is so a woman of the people. She’s just like you. (Except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from Disingenuous Lying Seahag Syndrome). Bill Clinton is just like you! (Minus being an unapologetic rapist, of course.) Chelsea Clinton is just like you! (Except for getting paid $600,000 a year by NBC to basically do nothing.)\n\nBill and Hillary are notorious for charging a sinful amount of money to speak at events. We’re talking $250,000+. Luckily, their daughter Chelsea is a lot more affordable. She’ll speak and take some photos for a measly $65,000. That’s it. Talk about a bargain. But wait– it gets BETTER!\n\nThe Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “Conversation with Chelsea” event at Penn State University Wednesday. And look. The Clintons understand that college students aren’t made of money, so they decided to charge students $500 to attend the event. A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $1,000 and could get access to the reception for $2,700.\n\nTalk about a deal!\n\nSo $500 bare minimum. I mean, $500 is nothing to a broke college student, amirite?\n\nJust kidding. Even college students– individuals famous for being progressive Clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that Hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “conversation” with Chelsea.\n\n“Although we certainly support Chelsea’s right to campaign on her mother’s behalf, we do not agree with Mrs. Clinton choosing to make this ‘conversation’ available exclusively to individuals who can afford or are willing to pay at least $500,” said Ethan Paul, vice president of College Progressives of Penn State, the newspaper reported Wednesday. “It is particularly deplorable that a $2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with Mrs. Clinton.” “Putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics,” added College Progressive Secretary Kathryn Van Develde.\n\nBut listen, kids. Hillary understands you. She really does. And she thinks it’s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree. Please pay $2,700 to talk to her about it.\n\nh/t Washington Times\n\nShare Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:",

    "content": "Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nThe problems surrounding the Clinton Foundation continue to worsen.\n\nWe know that over half of Hillary Clinton’s meetings during her tenure as secretary of state (85 of 154 people) were with individuals who either donated to her slush fund or pledged to support one of its international programs. We know the Clinton Foundation accepted donations from sketchy foreign entities. We know half of the staffers paid under the GSA program also worked for the Clinton Foundation. We know Hillary’s former chief of staff at the State Department, Cheryl Mills, also worked for the Clinton Foundation while working for the State. We know the Clinton Foundation spent 10 percent of its budget on charitable grants in 2013.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation claims that “88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work,” but one has to wonder. How does spending $8.5 million (or 10% of the budget) on travel– plane tickets, hotel accommodations, etc.– change lives? Heck, $4.8 million (or 5.6 percent) of the 2013 budget went toward office supplies. Dead serious. Blank paper and staplers are pricey, I guess. Call it “overhead” all you want, but it’s absurd. Just take a deeper look.\n\nIf you didn’t think it could get any worse, I’m sorry. You’re wrong.\n\nIn 2014, only 5.7% of the Clinton Foundation’s budget went to charitable grants. Everything else covered staff salaries, travel and other benefits.\n\nThe organization’s IRS filings revealed that it spend just short of $91.3 million in 2014. Of that, $5.2 million went to charity. Around $34.8 million went toward staff salaries and benefits, and $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses.” Oh. And $851,000 was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Fundraising can be expensive. Hillary knows all about that.\n\nBasically, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 but somehow managed to increase employee compensation and “other expenses” by $5 million each.\n\nThe Clintons are super charitable though. They donated over $1 million to charity last year! Who cares if $1 million went to their personal slush fund? They are so compassionate. Just kidding. Vice President Joe Biden can’t even get himself to say that the Clinton Foundation is ethical.\n\nh/t Daily Caller\n\nShare Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:",

Whether you’re addicted to nicotine, alcohol, meth or crack, even being 24-hours sober seems like a monumental achievement.\n\nOne woman, an ex-heroin addict, showed Reddit what happens when you decide to turn your life around and free yourself from the clutches of addiction. You can’t argue with the results, either.\n\nAddiction is a mental, physical, emotional and spiritual event, for want of a better term. Getting sober is tough for that very reason, but it’s necessary for the well-being of everyone involved, meaning the family and friends of the addict, as well as the addict themselves.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThe woman in question began a downward spiral into heroin addiction after her abusive boyfriend convinced her that it would make her feel better about the problems in her life, including losing custody of her daughter. She says that after 8 months of daily use and several failed attempts at getting sober, she finally told the judge in the case that she wanted to get clean. She was found in contempt of court and went to jail for 36 days before heading to rehab.\n\nAs you can see in her mugshot, this woman – who is unnamed – was feeling the physical and emotional affects of her disease.\n\nWhen she finally became dedicated to getting clean, her whole life changed, as is evidenced in this “after” picture, where she is 826 days sober, and counting.\n\nShe added the following to the end of her Reddit post:\n\n‘There are other addicts out there who are in the same circle of hell that I was in in that mug shot. So even if one of those people see this and get their sh*t together, then it was worth it.’\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with any kind of addiction, please know that it is okay to seek out help for them. You’re not intruding on their lives and while they may be furious with you for a period of time, they will come to see that you did what you had to do to make their lives better. There is no reason that someone should have to suffer from addiction for one more day.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "ISIS Is So Hard Up For Cash That It’s Harvesting Organs From Its OWN Dead And Injured Members\n\nPresident Obama routinely paints a rosy picture regarding the war on terror. He assures us that ISIS is decimated and that we have little to fear from the looming presence of radical Islam throughout the world.\n\nHe’s wrong. Not only are we engaged culturally in a very serious war with radical Islam, at best, our military efforts can only be described as hindrances to the advancement of the murderous elements of Islam.\n\nHowever, as weak as our response to ISIS has been, it is satisfying to see that our airstrikes are making life more difficult for the terrorist factions that require money to wage war.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nAccording to an Iraqi source, ISIS has begun harvesting the organs of their dead and dying in order to traffic the organs for cash as our airstrikes decimate their oil fields and rob them of the riches therein.\n\n“Special medical unit of the organization proceeded to steal human organs for about 23 ISIS militants of those who slept in the hospitals of Nineveh,” the Iraqi source said. “What has been stolen from those members included the kidneys, intestines and more; they were transferred under tight control to affiliated hospital on the outskirts of the city.”\n\nThe source who wished to remain anonymous for obvious reasons, said that the move comes as a reaction to the decimation of oil fields.\n\n“This came after the loss of the majority of sources of financial funding, particularly with regard to crude oil, which it provides about 80% of the imports of the terrorist organization.”\n\nIt is gratifying to see that ISIS must tighten their belts. However, what the world needs is a complete and thorough domination and destruction of radical Islam and so long as the Western world confuses idiocy with tolerance, it’s unlikely that we will see the leadership necessary to fix this problem.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It takes a hold of your life, turns it upside down and very rarely ever lets you go.\n\nAnother drug that has taken the streets by storm is the drug SPICE…otherwise known as K2. Its toted as giving the same effects that marijuana does, but it’s synthetically made, so it doesn’t occur naturally. Also, a small detail to this drug is that it completely drives the user batshit crazy!\n\nThere have been multiple reports of the drug being used on the streets, with the results being bodies of people completely strung out, laying around on the roads and sidewalks. Now of course there are a plethora of different types of the drug, all ranging in different highs. The user themselves matter as well, with some claiming that the high is just as good as marijuana, without any real adverse effects…then there are others, like this guy, who have complete nightmares…\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nIn the case of this man, he believed he was receiving cannabis straight out…no doubt he was familiar with it as he stated: ‘Don’t tell me how to smoke weed, man’. He had no idea what he was actually smoking was indeed spice. This led to his elevated mood at first, relaxation and then ultimately an altered perception of reality…this was supposed to be a joke…I’m sure everyone that cares about him is just laughing their heads off about it.\n\nThe mean was seen stumbling and falling all around, while the wastes of life were laughing and taking their sick advantage of the situation. The video ends with him completely laid out on the ground, with the idiots around him mumbling and walking off.\n\nDrugs are a hell of a freak show when someone is under their influence. Best to take this video as a reminder to stay away from this particular one…if you don’t want to see your skin melt right off of you.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Is This The BEST America Has To Offer? How Islamic Terror MUST Be Fought. [VIDEO]\n\nThe attacks are here. They are not new and they are not going anywhere. They could be virtually for the most part eliminated from our shores, but that would take the leadership and a government body that was willing to go against the grain when other world leaders are in their weakness, condemning America for being ‘racists’ or ‘xenophobes’. Leadership that is willing to admit that what we have been doing up until now doesn’t work, in fact, it enables further attacks and further slaughter of American innocents. Leadership that wholeheartedly denies the erroneous communistic way of thinking known as Political Correctness.\n\nNone of these things will ever happen. They cannot happen. Not until the leaders of this nation stop weighing and measuring the quid-pro-quo way of doing business. Every day what is brought out on talk radio, on news networks, by Hollywood, is more feeling and thoughts of how to handle the day’s latest political crisis. The latest gag by Hillary Clinton or the recent back peddle by Donald Trump, and a large portion of America, the majority, is scratching their heads saying, “Are these the two best candidates in the entire nation?”\n\nAny hope of a better candidate swooping in and saving the day is a false hope. The truth is we did this to ourselves. We appoint our elected officials and they in turn make the decisions that we as a town, city, county, state and a nation have to deal with. One of those major decisions is how we combat terrorism. I say terrorism because we as a people can’t even come to the same conclusion that terrorism for a very long time has solely been perpetrated by Islamic fundamentalists. After this weekend’s attacks, America has been reminded that the war isn’t over. The war on our culture and way of life rages on, even if the tragedys are out of sight, out of mind.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nSenator Ted Cruz has released a statement that is dubbed ‘a clear-eyed’ approach to combating terrorism:\n\n“Terrorist attacks over the last several days across our homeland, from Manhattan to Minnesota, indicate we are moving into a new phase of the war against ISIS and al Qaida, who are increasingly targeting Europe and the United States. Two years ago, a focused, aggressive military campaign against ISIS’s claimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq might have effectively destroyed the terrorist group, but ISIS has instead spent the last year seeding radicals in the West, disguising jihadis as refugees and radicalizing Muslim citizens online and encouraging them to remain in the U.S. and fight here. Meanwhile, other networks such as al Qaida and the Taliban remain determined to resume the attacks on America that began on September 11, 2001. As we confront this new phase, we must avoid the trap of misconceiving these attacks as isolated incidents somehow disconnected from the larger ideological struggle against jihad. It is past time to take off the blinders and call the enemy what it is: radical Islamic terrorism engaged in a coordinated campaign designed to disrupt our very way of life. We must start by fully supporting our law enforcement community, from the heroic off-duty officer Jason Falconer, who neutralized the terrorist in the St. Cloud mall, saving many lives, to the FBI officers in New York who have worked swiftly to identify and apprehend the likely mastermind of the weekend bombings. We also desperately need the active participation of American Muslims who see the jihadis for what they are: the enemies of all who celebrate freedom and tolerance. Congress should act to prevent Americans who have traveled abroad for training from returning here, and to stop the flow of refugees from hotbeds of terrorism in the Middle East that President Obama is determined to bring to our country. We can’t overcome our enemies by pretending they don’t exist, and undermining our first line of defenders. Only together, clear-eyed and determined, can we defeat this foe.”\n\nThe first step is recognizing that we have a problem. Ted Cruz, as well as so many other patriots have. But none of this is going to have even a remote chance of coming to fruition if we as citizens continue to choose leaders that have proven themselves to be corrupt and unworthy stewards of this God-given nation.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Philadelphia Eagles Tell America To Screw Off With NEW Sign Of Disrespect On The Field…\n\nIf you are an Eagles fan, I would certainly hope that you put your country and freedom before racism. Me personally, I’d boycott them and I’m this close to boycotting the entire NFL even though there are some good guys in it. Four Philadelphia Eagles players raised the Black Power fist at their game during the National Anthem. I’ve had it with this crap.\n\nI’ve seen other players do this as well. Hell, I’ve seen the Obamas do it too. It is totally unacceptable… it is a radical, racist gesture and should not be tolerated. No more than a Nazi salute would be tolerated. Did you know that Sports Illustrated just went all-in with the Black Lives Matter inspired anti-cop/anti-white NFL black protests, allocating the back-page essay to Jacksonville Jaguars player Jared Odrick? Yep, cross them off as well.\n\nFrom Gateway Pundit:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet It’s an Obama world. Last week NFL players were sitting during the National Anthem. Now they’re raising the Black Power fist. On Monday four Eagles players raised the black power fist during the National Anthem. Malcolm Jenkins and few teammates with fists in air during National Anthem. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/lLW8ZoYUUn — John Clark CSN (@JClarkCSN) September 20, 2016\n\nThis comes just days after a black man ambushed a police officer in her car in Philadelphia, shooting her eight times in the arm. The only thing that saved her was her bullet proof vest. He went on to shoot a security guard and then take a human shield. He shot that woman in the leg as well. Then he dumped 14 rounds into a car with two people in it. He killed the woman and critically wounded the man. Then he shot another officer who obligingly sent him straight to hell where he belongs. Then these football players pushed racial hate at an Eagles game in essence celebrating that.\n\nThese are wealthy anti-American bigots and I think the fans have had just about enough of this. We love America, our military and our police. This nation was well on her way to being colorblind until Obama took over. Now, we are at each other’s throats and a race war is looming. These whiny rich football players, who have been free to play their sport and get wealthy off it, hate the country and the fans who empowered them to live a privileged life. I say revoke the privilege over this. No game is worth condoning racism and hatred this way.\n\nFour Eagles raise fist during national anthem https://t.co/b6trACydIO sports pic.twitter.com/4BVVwxQhkC — BILL SOURCE (@billsource) September 20, 2016\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Democrats Scared Stiff After Seeing What Hillary Needed To Get Up…\n\nHillary Clinton’s optics don’t get much worse than this… unless of course she has seizures, her knees buckle and she’s lifted/dragged into a van – all in front of the media and on 9/11. At Temple University, which has 38,000 students, Clinton had a rally… one that probably held less than 200 attendees. If you go to her site, it says the event reached capacity. What a spin. It also looked to me like there were about as many in the press there as there were students. Just pathetic. As you can see below, a Trump rally draws thousands and is packed.\n\nAnd it’s not just the attendance. Clinton had to climb all of four stairs to get to the podium and exit the stage. In the pic below, you see a man having to help her as if she is elderly and bordering on being an invalid. Not exactly the picture of health or a strong leader to say the least. Wonder if Vegas is taking bets on her life expectancy.\n\nFrom Top Right News:\n\nBetween the shoe closet rallies, lack of interest and obvious health issues… the Hildabeast is in real trouble here. Her ground game right now sucks… in Delaware, Ohio with a population of over 2 million, no one showed for a door knocking event. Add to that disclosures on Reddit that her go-to IT guy and Clinton were looking for ways to cover her tracks on emails and you have a political nuclear bomb.\n\nBut there’s more! WikiLeaks is about to dump info. on Clinton smuggling weapons in Benghazi to al Qaeda. Something Glenn Beck predicted from the beginning. That scandal is getting ready to re-explode.\n\nWith all of this, one of several things could happen… she could lose in a landslide to Trump, which is looking more and more likely… Clinton could drop dead before the election or she could get impeached right after being elected. Not good. The Democrats made a massive mistake in not going with someone else. They are scared stiff and should be.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hillary Clinton VOWS To Defend BlackLivesMatter Agenda by Dealing With White People to Stop ‘Racial Police Shootings’ [VIDEO]\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement claims that racism is endemic among the country’s law enforcement agencies — and Hillary Clinton evidently agrees. Rather than understanding that there are a few bad apples in any profession, they paint all police officers with a racist brush. And now, she’s found a new opportunity to pander some more.\n\nTerence Crutcher is a black man who was shot by police officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was unarmed and in the police video, can be seen with his hands in the air and his back to police when he was first tazed and then shot. At no point does Crutcher make any aggressive moves towards police, yet for some inexplicable reason, he was shot and killed anyway.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThe video makes it clear: this was murder, plain and simple. And the officers responsible should be fully prosecuted. There’s no getting around that. But of course, Hillary used it as an opportunity to smear all police officers, and to stoke racial tensions.\n\nAppearing on The Steve Harvey Show, Hillary talked about the Crutcher shooting. “We gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?” she asked. “This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable.” Lucky for us, Hillary has a solution to this nationwide problem: vote for her, of course, and these shootings will end!\n\n“Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people [and] say, ‘Look this is not who we are. We’ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias’,” she said. “We can do better. We have got to reign in what is absolutely inexplicable.”\n\nWhile she did pay lip service to the many “good honorable cool-headed” police officers around the country, she had absolutely no problem whatsoever exploiting this tragedy in an effort to get more votes. And that’s despicable. She couldn’t even wait for Crutcher’s family to bury him before she started using him as an opportunity to ask people to vote for her. Isn’t she ashamed? Is she not embarrassed? Because really, she should be.\n\nWhat she’s doing is blatant race-baiting. It’s infuriating that liberals can so easily inflame racial tensions for their own gains, while calling everyone else racist. They’re trying to start a race war, and they’re doing it so they can place themselves in positions of power. That’s disgusting.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Angelina Jolie Files For DIVORCE From Brad Pitt – For Reasons You Wouldn’t Have Guessed [VIDEO]\n\nAngelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were one of Hollywood’s most high-profile couples. But apparently, that is all over now: Angelina Jolie has just filed for divorce.\n\nJolie, 41, cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for splitting from her husband of just two years. Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, but their relationship controversially began while Pitt was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston, in 2004 while they were filming the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Pitt and Aniston divorced in January of 2005 and just months later, Pitt and Jolie went public with their relationship with her adopted son Maddox. Jolie adopted another child, a girl from Ethiopia, and then announced that she was pregnant with Pitt’s child. The couple adopted another child in 2007 before giving birth to twins in 2008.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nWhile Pitt and Jolie had been together since 2004, they didn’t get engaged until 2012. The pair reportedly were waiting to get married until LGBT couples could also get married.\n\nReports say that Jolie was angry with Pitt’s parenting style. She allegedly felt that Pitt was not safe around their kids, was unhappy with his alleged marijuana use, and thought he has anger issues. It has also been reported that Jolie hired a private detective to spy on him while he was filming his latest movie in London, because she suspected that he was cheating on her. Those suspicions were allegedly confirmed by the detective.\n\nJolie is also known for her humanitarian work and is a United Nations special envoy, recently appearing before the UN to speak on behalf of Syrian refugees. Pitt, meanwhile, was reportedly much more interested in being part of Hollywood, making movies and going to parties.\n\nIt has been reported that Jolie is requesting sole custody of the couple’s six children and is seeking to have Pitt be given visitation rights only. Attorney Laura Wasser is said to be representing Jolie in the divorce, who also represented actress Amber Heard in her divorce from Johnny Depp earlier this year.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Obama Tells America to Protect HIS Legacy – Thanks HIMSELF For All the “Great Things” He’s Done In 8 Years [VIDEO]\n\nObama’s time as president is almost over and millions of Americans are counting down the days until he vacates the Oval Office. He promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change America and he did… for the worse. It’s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he’s left office, considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure. But that hasn’t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling Americans that they need to protect his legacy once he’s left office.\n\nIn a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night, Obama used Jim Crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “right” candidate. He told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake, so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote. And those people, of course, need to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nWhile Obama did not mention Hillary by name, he said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her. “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” he said. “And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate who’s defining principal, the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done.” He then cited the historic turnout among the African-American community in 2008 and 2012, saying, “I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down it’s guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send off? Go vote!”\n\nOf course, history contradicts everything that Obama said. It was Democrats, not Republicans, that supported slavery, segregation and Jim Crow laws. The Republican Party was formed specifically to end slavery. The original Congressional Black Caucus were the first black members of Congress… and they were Republicans. Democrats came up with the Ku Klux Klan in order to prevent black Americans from voting.\n\nMeanwhile, Obama’s actual legacy with the black community isn’t exactly stellar. It was the Obama administration that cancelled D.C.’s school voucher program, so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools, like the one Obama’s children got to attend. And under Obama’s leadership, unemployment and food stamp usage have skyrocketed, hitting the black community harder than any other. He’s done nothing about the destruction of the black family, the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year, or the fact that almost 76% of black children are born out of wedlock.\n\nAnd he wants to brag about his legacy? Is he out of his mind?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children’s future.” Calling the United States a ‘small country’ was insult enough, but to decide to use America as a tool to ‘achieve universal aspirations of mankind’ is quite another. Mankind doesn’t have any ‘Universal aspirations’. It’s hard enough to get Americans within the same culture to agree on one thing, let alone the whole world of many cultures. I am no conspiracy theorist, but the phrase ‘New World Order’ was coined by our 41st President, so we will have this discussion with that one thing in mind.\n\nIt was reported that George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush wanted to stay silent about the upcoming race for the Presidency and who they support. But former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy wanted to find out who Bush Sr. was supporting for the Presidency. She asked him and then immediately took a selfie with him and posted his response on Facebook.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!” In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. “That’s what he said,” she told POLITICO.\n\nAsked about Townsend’s post, George H.W. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.”\n\nI guess my question to you is this: Does it surprise you that the man who said the United States is small and that we must unite in a ‘New World Order’ might be voting for Hillary Clinton? They are very similar in belief. While President, Bush Sr. allowed many of the U.N. entrapments to sneak past our Congress. He introduced the U.N.’s Common Core education, which is an arm of Agenda 21 into our education system in the 90’s. Hillary Clinton also believes the United States to be small and should be more under the reign of U.N. treaties and such. They are not very different at all. Now Trump? That guy is not part of that elite group trying to ‘achieve the universal aspirations of mankind’. He’s all for himself which means in turn he would be the kind of President who would be ALL about the United States. He doesn’t believe the U.S. is one small country, like a cog in a machine. Trump believes that the U.S. IS the machine. Trump’s are not the type of ideals that Bush wants in the White House. It’s dangerous because before you know it the United States would become a sovereign nation in the world once again and then what happens to all the Bush’s and Clinton’s work?\n\nMany former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.\n\nOne Bush official who has taken Trump’s side is former Vice President Dan Quayle, who told POLITICO in an interview this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump. “Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president, but they can speak for themselves,” Quayle said in an interview in July.\n\nDan Quayle was such a stud and polar opposite to GHW Bush. It was very sad for our country to end up with Bush Sr. after Reagan and not a Dan Quayle.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nCNN recently ran an article titled, “Donald Trump defends racial profiling in wake of bombs.” Now, let’s first ignore the fact that once again, CNN is more upset over how we talk about the terror suspect and his religious affiliation than the fact that he allegedly set off bombs intended to hurt people and shot at cops during his capture. CNN claims Trump “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police amid increasing threats to the homeland.”\n\nTranslation: Donald Trump is a RAAAAAAACIST!\n\nBut here’s the thing. Trump never even mentioned racial profiling. He was praising Israel’s extraordinary vetting methods, which involves profiling, especially at the airport. And guess what? It works for them.\n\n“Our police are amazing. Our local police — they know who a lot of these people are. They are afraid to do anything about it because they don’t want to be accused of profiling and they don’t want to be accused of all sorts of things,” Trump said.\n\n“You know, in Israel they profile. They’ve done an unbelievable job, as good as you can do. But Israel has done an unbelievable job, and they’ll profile. They see somebody that’s suspicious, they will profile. They will take that person and they’ll check out,” he continued. “Do we have a choice? Look what’s going on. Do we really have a choice? We’re trying to be so politically correct in our country. And this is only going to get worse.”\n\nProfiling doesn’t necessarily mean racial profiling. CNN completely made that up, because they want to advance the false narrative that Trump’s a giant racist.\n\nCNN even admitted that Trump didn’t actually say “racial” profiling in that very article.\n\nTrump did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects, but it’s illegal for police to subject US persons to disparate treatment based on their race or other protected status.\n\nSo Trump “did not say on what attributes he would encourage police to profile possible suspects,” but in the VERY FIRST PARAGRAPH, CNN definitively claims that he “reiterated his support for the controversial practice of racial profiling by police.”\n\nThey made a claim and basically debunked it two paragraphs later. In what world is that considered fair and balanced reporting?\n\nShare Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:",

    "content": "Share Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nAccording to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.\n\nCase in point.\n\nThe specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.\n\nThis is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.\n\nThe AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?\n\nIn others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.\n\nWow.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?\n\nShare Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:",

I know what they say they’re supposed to do, but what is their actual purpose? I mean, if you tell them and you know that someone in your family is engaged in terrorist activity and it coincides with the rise of ISIS and they do nothing, what are we paying them to do exactly?\n\nI hope they feel terrible about themselves and what’s more, I hope they are ordered to pay the medical bills of the victims, as well as the pain and suffering and lost wages.\n\nWhat is the point of the government telling us “see something, say something” if when we see something and say something, nothing comes of it until the attempted murder of American citizens?\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nAhmad Khan Rahami, the man who is being accused of creating and/or detonating hidden IEDs in New York/New Jersey, was captured by police. Afterward, it was revealed that his own father had reported him to the Federal Bureau of Investigations in 2014 for “being a terrorist” according to The New York Times.\n\nTwo years before Ahmad Khan Rahami went on a bombing rampage in New York and New Jersey, his father told the police that the son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two senior law enforcement officials. The father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to New Jersey police in 2014, when Mr. Rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother. The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted.\n\nIt is thought that the father only made the comment out of anger at his son, but it was very clear that he knew something he didn’t actually want the FBI to investigate.\n\nIs the father also accountable for his son’s actions for recanting a statement that was clearly true and putting decent, hardworking Americans at risk? Or is this just on his son, who was the actual creator and distributor of the explosive devices?\n\nIn my opinion, there’s enough blame to go around. Obviously, the actual terrorist himself receives the bulk of it, but I also would like to point my finger at the father who (it would seem) hid what he knew about his son’s activities and the FBI who didn’t continue the investigation.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?\n\nThe idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.\n\nWhat exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.\n\nBut why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\n*insert mechanical applause here*\n\nBut what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?\n\nIt’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:\n\nI mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?\n\nFor an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.\n\nOf course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nBack in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”\n\nThis reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.\n\nEither way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Milo Yiannopoulos: It’s Time To Criminalize Black Lives Matter [VIDEO]\n\nMake no mistake: the political differences ripping America apart are not merely political ones, but cultural ones as well. We are a culture at war with ourselves. We are separated into the “victim” role and the supposed “oppressor” role. Straights, whites and Christians are alleged to be the oppressors of all others and a new breed of radicalism has crept up to instill social warfare against these groups to further a self-pitying social and political agenda.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is a domestic hate group that furthers hatred for whites and for police officers in a way that the KKK has fostered hatred for minorities. Now, according to outspoken conservative Milo Yiannopoulos, it’s time to criminalize this hate group.\n\n“The left does this insane sleight of hand where they try to suggest not liking Black Lives Matter is the same thing as hating black people,” he said during his visit to the University of Houston for his “Dangerous Faggot” tour.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\n“No one is stupid enough to believe that but they keep doing it,” he added.\n\nYiannopoulos admitted that there are problems plaguing black communities, but suggested that BLM is not the solution, saying that a “violent movement that throws its toys out the pram and leaves black communities in ruins is [not] the answer to those problems.”\n\n“We are entering the black power phase of Black Lives Matter existence and it is crossing over into a terrorist organization. It’s time to criminalize it,” he stated.\n\nWhile it would be unconstitutional and wrong to criminalize political speech of any kind, we cannot escape the precedent that is already in place. The KKK is (thankfully) a tattered shred of what it used to be in terms of organization after it was ruled that their urging of violence in the name of hatred was a conspiratorial enterprise to commit lawlessness.\n\nWhile any bigot – black or white – should be free to spout off their nonsense, it is time to delegitimize these racists by holding them responsible for the violent conduct they encourage and urge.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "A Marine family in Michigan said goodbye to its beloved K-9 with a fitting funeral.\n\nRico was a Marine K-9 who served two tours in Afghanistan and was part of more than 240 missions and 30 firefights. He lived just over 12 years by the side of his owner, Marine Staff Sgt. Russ Beckley, Jr.\n\n“There was not a moment when it wasn’t his mission or his goal to be by my side. I was everything to him. And he was everything to me,” Beckley told WOOD.\n\nAfter spending more than a year apart, Beckley and Rico were reunited in mid-June at the sergeant’s parents’ home. The dog was in declining health due to age, and the family had made the decision to have him put down.\n\n“Mainly I was thinking about how loyal he was to our family. To my son. To myself. And to our country,” Russ Beckley, Sr. said of his last moment with the dog. “He just kinda melted into my arms and we had a very nice goodbye.”\n\nBeckley said he “thanked Rico” for everything he’d done for him.\n\n“And I told him that I loved him,” he added. The dog then got a proper military send-off, with Beckley lowering his American flag to half-staff and visitors coming to pay their respects at a memorial set up by the family. Beckley and his father -- dressed in their uniforms -- carried their beloved dog in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nBeckley said that while it’s hard saying goodbye his beloved dog, he knows it isn’t the last time they’ll be together.\n\n“I can just imagine one day, seeing my great grandfather, my grandfather, my father and my mother, standing there with Rico. And we will all be together again,” he said.",

    "content": "SUBMIT OR PERISH: Obama Demands Limits on American Freedoms at the UN [VIDEO]\n\nAccording to Barack Obama, what is necessary for countries to defeat terrorism is not a steadfast resolve to decimate these savages with sophisticated military operations. It is not a steadfast resolve to bring the fight to radical Islam.\n\nNope, according to Barack Obama, the answer for countering terrorism rests in submitting to a one-world style of government and a willingness to “limit freedom.”\n\nSpeaking before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Obama told world leaders that our only hope is to rely upon collaborative bodies of government like the UN and relinquishing our freedoms – our “freedom of action” as he put it.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nObama also stated that “powerful nations” like the U.S. will have to limit their freedom in order to submissively submit to the will of the international body – a belief for which Obama acknowledges he has been criticized.\n\n“We have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions, but I’m convinced in the long run giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to international rules, over the long-term, enhances our security.”\n\nThe UN was a noble experiment, but one that has long been proven to be a failed one. The practical purpose of the UN is nothing more than serving as an agency for redistribution of wealth and power amongst nations. In this body, the U.S. and other powerful nations do the heavy lifting and are only rewarded with limitations, cynicism and collectivist-inspired resentment from other nations.\n\nSince America elected a president who prioritizes the needs of other nations over the needs of the one he has sworn to serve, we have fared poorly on the global stage and it is hardly surprising to see that our outgoing coward has remained true to his vision of one-world governance and limitations of freedom throughout the world.\n\nRemember when America had presidents that believed in America so much that they stressed that the rest of the world should try to strive for our kind of ideals instead of the other way around?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "CHAOS Taking Over Charlotte After Fatal Shooting – Police Under Attack, Protesters RIOTING… [VIDEO]\n\nI watched both shootings of black men play out yesterday and I have something to say about each of them here today.\n\nThe shooting in Tulsa, where I live, is being portrayed as a white cop shooting an innocent black man. Not quite. Terence Crutcher has a rap sheet a mile long. He had been arrested at least 12 times previously. They found PCP in his stalled SUV. What the media would have you believe is that he was just standing by his stalled car when the evil cops showed up and shot him while he had his arms raised. He was indeed unarmed, but as you will see in the video below, he was walking with his arms and hands raised after being told repeatedly to stop by the police. He kept on going until he got back to his car and then he started to reach in the window for something. That is when a white, female officer shot him fatally. His attorney is claiming the window was up when he arrived… it is pretty clear that the guy was reaching inside that vehicle when he was shot.\n\nTwo officers fired simultaneously – one a taser and one a gun. It was a justified shooting – he was not shot with his hands up. From my viewpoint, the officer followed procedure. Was she supposed to wait and see if he pulled a gun and fired on them before shooting the guy? No, that is not how they are trained. The guy was not obeying commands and he looked high to me. Hundreds showed up in Tulsa last night to protest… it was Black Lives Matter again. Originally, people said he was a pastor… not true, he was a criminal and the officers acted in a way to protect themselves as a last resort.\n\nNow, onto North Carolina, where the black man was armed, shot and killed as well… by a black police officer.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nFrom Gateway Pundit:\n\nProtests erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina Tuesday after 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer. The man was reportedly shot by a black officer. Protesters attacked police, hit a reporter in the head with a rock and trashed a police cruiser. The shooting occurred around 4 p.m. at The Village at College Downs apartment complex in northeast Charlotte. According to WBTV, officers said they were searching for a person with an outstanding warrant when they saw a man get out of a vehicle with a firearm. Lamont Scott got out of the vehicle “armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject.” Black Lives Matter activists gathered tonight to protest the shooting.\n\nThey’re hurling water bottles at police.\n\nTwelve police officers were injured last night as hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters rioted and looted after Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte. His daughter is circulating a video claiming he was innocent of course… a father of seven, reading in his car and waiting for his son to get home from school and that he was unarmed. That’s touching, but it’s not reality according to the police and just as in Tulsa, I’m far more willing to believe the police here than BLM.\n\nAccording to officers, they were looking for a suspect when they came across Scott in his car. They were in plain clothes and ordered Scott out of his car. He got out with a gun and then got back in. He got out a second time still with his gun in hand and they took him down because he was an armed threat. A gun was recovered from the scene.\n\nSeveral hundred rioters went to town last night in Charlotte. They threw bricks and water bottles at the police. The police lobbed tear gas at the rioters. The BLM asshats stole cargo off trucks and set fire to it in the middle of the street. They tried to loot a Walmart and were pushed back by police. They destroyed two police vehicles and assaulted the media. They set trucks on fire as well.\n\n“We out like the Taliban!” one rioter could be heard crying on a Facebook Live broadcast of the protests, shortly after tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. After 11 pm, the situation grew more severe, with several people successfully trashing a police SUV.\n\nThe police also used flash grenades to disperse the crowds. I didn’t see any, but I’ll bet pepper spray was used as well. Some protesters were heard yelling ‘Black Lives Matter!’ and ‘Hands up, don’t shoot!’. They held up a sign saying ‘Stop Killing Us!’ and ‘It was a book!’, making reference to the object Scott was reportedly holding when he was shot dead.\n\nOfficer Brentley Vinson – a former college football player – was identified as the officer who shot Scott, WCCB reports. Officer Vinson, who has worked at the department since July of 2014 and is also black, has been placed on paid on administrative leave, as is standard procedure in such cases.\n\nWhat you are seeing is a ginned up race war with cop-hatred for fuel. Both of these incidents were justified and the police were doing their jobs. If you do not obey a police officer repeatedly, you are going to get shot. If you have a gun and brandish it at them, you are going to get shot. Black Lives Matter is a radical, racist terrorist group and its members should be treated as such.\n\nFor context, the shooting of Terence Crutcher:\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "New Clinton Foundation SCANDAL Just Broke – This Is What Hillary ACTUALLY Thinks About Black People…\n\nThis is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.\n\nRanbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.\n\n“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\n“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.\n\nThis could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.\n\nRanbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.\n\nCompanies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant. Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general… their primary interest is monetary.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BREAKING: FBI Director James Comey – SUBPOENAED By Congress For Letting Hillary Off The Hook!\n\nIt looks like FBI Director James Comey is sitting in a pot of hot water and the temperature is steadily being increased. He let Hillary Clinton skate completely on the email scandal. He even said she was lying and was guilty, but let her off anyway. No one can figure out why either.\n\nComey released highly redacted notes of his interview with Hillary Clinton. They were practically useless. Attorney General Loretta Lynch is just as complicit for meeting with Bill Clinton just before Hillary testified to the FBI. Obviously, briefing him on what Hillary should and should not say.\n\nCongress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nFrom the Independent Journal Review:\n\nThe FBI Director’s recommendation to the Attorney General not to indict Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for legal infractions with her private email server while at the State Department still has many political observers shaking their heads over the obvious legal double standard. The decision-making of FBI Director Comey, who recently sent highly redacted notes of his interview process and investigation of Hillary Clinton, and Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who had a private meeting with Bill Clinton prior to her case being dismissed, have been highly scrutinized. After grilling Comey on the Hill, Congress requested that the director deliver certain documents so lawmakers could better understand the scope and breadth of Hillary Clinton’s extra-legal email activities. The director has reportedly failed to deliver, and now Congress is once again trying to get transparency. The Washington Examiner reported: House Committee on Science, Space and Technology Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, subpoenaed FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday for documents and information related to the security of the private email account and server Hillary Clinton used when she led the State Department. Smith asked Comey for the documents in a Sept. 9 letter, but then issued the subpoena after Comey failed to comply with the request.\n\n“The committee continues to have questions about the structure and security of the email system used by former Secretary Clinton and whether she and her staff employed cybersecurity standards required by FISMA,” the statement from the committee read. But I doubt they will ever get the answers they are seeking… they will get stonewalled by the Obama Administration, the FBI and the Clintons, just as they always do.\n\nWe seem to no longer have three functioning separate branches of government in this nation. The Executive Branch seems to rule over all now, making the Judicial Branch submissive to it and the Legislative Branch all but irrelevant. There is no better example of that than the corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The streets were reopened and it was back to business as usual in Times Square.\n\nBusiness as usual on 42 Street. Everything back up and running after bomb scare #TimesSquare @fox5ny pic.twitter.com/mvxbPUV3wa — Liz Dahlem (@lizdahlem) September 21, 2016\n\nAfter the bombing in Chelsea, New Yorkers are understandably on high alert for any kind of suspicious behavior or unusual packages. Thankfully, it was a false alarm, but the people who spoke up absolutely did the right thing by notifying police. We know there are ISIS sleeper cells in the United States. There have been multiple confirmed terrorist attacks recently. It’s not the time to be complacent; everyone needs to be keeping their eyes open and be on the lookout for people behaving unusually.\n\nRemember: if you see something, say something.

    "content": "NRA Unleashes Chilling Ad: ‘Don’t Let Hillary Leave You Defenseless” [VIDEO]\n\nHillary Clinton wants to take your guns. That has been made clear as she has never shied away from shilling for gun control. But the National Rifle Association isn’t going to let her get away with it without a fight. They’ve already released a good number of brutal ads targeting Hillary, but the newest one points out how, if Hillary is elected, she will do everything she can to leave you defenseless.\n\nHillary, and her liberal anti-gun followers, will of course try to claim that all they want is “common sense” gun reform. But what Hillary wants isn’t just some kind of mild gun reform, like requiring a background check before someone can purchase a gun. She wants things like a 25% tax on guns and refuses to say that she believes that the Second Amendment is constitutional. She even praised the Australian gun buyback program, where Australian citizens had their guns confiscated by the government.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nOf course, Hillary doesn’t hate all guns. She just doesn’t want Americans to be armed. She has armed security guards protecting her every single day, so she doesn’t have to worry about potentially defending herself in a life-or-death situation. She also doesn’t care if you ever need to defend yourself. She’s safe and that’s all that matters. She wants to force you to rely on the government for protection.\n\nThat’s why the NRA’s new ad works. People don’t want to be defenseless. Police officers are fantastic and they risk their lives every day to protect Americans… but they can’t be everywhere at once. If someone is in danger, it will take police a few minutes to get there. And without guns, there is literally nothing they can do to defend themselves. Hillary’s plan actually does leave Americans defenseless.\n\nWorst of all, gun control doesn’t work. Look at Chicago, with their super strict gun control laws. They still have some of the highest gun violence numbers in the country. Australia still has problems with gun violence, particularly with gangs and drug dealers, despite forcibly confiscating people’s guns. Gun control doesn’t work. And that’s why liberals like Hillary have to lie and use fear to force their agenda into action. The only question is, will Americans fall for it?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BREAKING: Judge DEMANDS Release Of Clinton’s Security Training Files – She Has 5 Days…\n\nJust like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.\n\nHuma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.\n\nJudge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.\n\nState Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh. That’s for peons, not the elite evidently.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "PAYBACK: National Anthem Protests Are Costing the NFL Viewership\n\nThis is just beautiful. This is the way it should be. No government involvement, no forcing people to do things they don’t want to do, just the people using their views to give their opinions on the NFL National Anthem controversy.\n\nI’m not a big sports fan, but I know several people who are. They bleed their team colors and are a little too serious about winning. They would travel across the country to see their team play and they have cut their ties with the NFL.\n\nTheir hardcore devotion to their team is not enough to get them past the fact that they don’t want to see the country they love disrespected by people who have done nothing but gain from our freedom.\n\nJames Olson is not alone, but he is a perfect example of what millions of Americans are feeling right now.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet James Olson, a Sports Illustrated subscriber since fourth grade, watches action-packed NFL games on TV to escape from the endless round of political bickering playing out on other channels. But with more national anthem protests cropping up, he feels like politics has taken over his favorite sport, too. So he’s tuning out. “I want to say to these guys ‘If you weren’t playing in the NFL, you would be working at McDonalds. I think people have had it,” said, Olson, a Birmingham, Mich., resident.\n\nPeople don’t watch sports for half-baked political statements, they watch because they like to see their favorite player score, giving them bragging rights until the next game. If they wanted politics, they’d turn on the news.\n\nWhat happens when a beloved sport like football becomes entwined with something as deeply divisive as politics?\n\nWell according to Forbes, the first official game of the season brought in 13% fewer viewers than last year. This, they said, is the lowest number of live viewers in the last seven years.\n\nSo, now I pose a question to you; should Americans turn off the TV when football comes on? Should we choose to support our nation over our favorite team and more importantly, do you actually think it will yield the desired results?

They can’t just let problems clear themselves up without trying to make things 1,000,000 times worse.\n\nWell, maybe not so much “people” as B.J. Murphy, a Muslim man who was chosen by Keith Lamont Scott’s family to speak about the man’s shooting death.\n\nOf course, he couldn’t just leave without praising Allah and ordering more violence from the rioters who, for some reason, think that stealing TVs from Walmart is the appropriate way to “protest police brutality.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nAfter telling the angry mob that blacks “don’t get no justice,” (because English is hard for some people) he said that he’s not “telling our brothers and sisters to stop,” referring to the crime that has been committed in the name of “justice.” You know, the same justice that they ain’t gettin’ none of? Or something.\n\nHis message was apparently SO effective that, according to the Daily Caller, Charlotte protesters were chanting “We’re like the Taliban!”\n\nThat’s what we need, Muslims taking advantage of angry Americans and creating more home-grown terrorists.\n\nCan this guy be arrested for inciting violence? Maybe for inciting a riot?\n\nOh, what am I saying… he’s one of the “protected classes” in America. The only thing the government would do to him is give him a federal job overseeing refugees and their paperwork.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "A hardworking farmer went on ABC's reality show \"Shark Tank\" to pitch his product, which simply exists to improve the lives of other farmers, and was mocked for his lack of business expertise (video below). But by the end of his pitch, he had an investor and had won over the hearts of all the sharks on the panel.\n\nJohnny Georges, a farmer and the inventor of the Tree T-Pee, brought his invention to \"Shark Tank,\" seeking an investment to help sell his product nationwide.\n\nAs he explained his product to the panel of sharks and revealed that he had only sold within five counties of his Florida farm, the sharks were stunned. They began nearly mocking him for his lack of business experience and questioning how the company was expected to succeed.\n\nGeorges tried to explain that he wants to do what is right and to help other farmers, so he only makes $1 per Tree T-Pee. The judges were shocked he hadn't expanded his market or raised his prices, but he remained faithful to the greater cause.\n\nFinally, Georges' character won the hearts of the panel and John Paul DeJoria, co-founder of hair care product company Paul Mitchell, offered to give him exactly what he asked for.\n\nThe moral of this story is certainly to stay true to who you are and what you believe in. Watch Georges' \"Shark Tank\" pitch below.",

    "content": "WEINER Gets Caught AGAIN! This Time With A 15 Yr-Old!? [VIDEO]\n\nThe Weiner is back, yet again, in the news and if you thought he couldn’t get any more disgusting, well you would be stupid…I mean, come on. It’s Anthony “Douche” Weiner…I like the sound of that.\n\nAnyways, back in January, Anthony Weiner, 51, who at the time wasn’t in the process of divorce with top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, supposedly engaged in a months-long online sexual relationship with a troubled 15 year-old girl whose name is being withheld for obvious reasons.\n\n“I have repeatedly demonstrated terrible judgement about the people I have communicated with online and the things I have sent,” stated Weiner as he was interviewed on FoxNews Online.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThe details are this. Back in January of 2016, Weiner had developed a knowing online sexting relationship with a 15 year-old girl. We know that he knew she was 15 because using the KIK, a popular social media app, he had asked the girl what high school she went to. Yeah, that kind of drains all doubt that he didn’t know she was underage.\n\nLet’s not forget, this man is married. So sexting with anyone but his wife still reveals that he’s just as horrible a person as ever…except now we know just how disgusting and evil this piece of turd is.\n\nBoth the girl and Weiner sent sexually charged pictures and texts back and forth. Weiner also eventually ended up at the girl’s home when her father wasn’t there. The girl claims that he prodded her into deeper sexual conversation until she stated she wasn’t comfortable with where it was heading and he immediately stopped.\n\nThe girl’s father is justifiably enraged by what has transpired and claims his daughter’s mental health is in jeopardy.\n\n“If there’s anybody out there that has a similar story that they can come forward, maybe use my daughter’s example to have the courage to come forward, I agreed because her mental health is in jeopardy and I didn’t want to exacerbate anything that she has mentally going on,” he continued. She’s gone through some depression, we’ve sought counseling and been able to help her work through it, he said. She’s a bright girl, very smart, so this has somewhat dulled the light that she had previous to this…it’s gut-wrenching to see somebody take that away.”\n\nAlright Dad. Wiener is a scumbag and he is a sexual predator, no doubt…but let’s give some sense of responsibility to where it’s due. Your daughter engaged in the relationship. She is not some innocent angel you believe she is. How the hell does Weiner end up inside your home? Did he break in?\n\nJust be honest about it.\n\nWeiner’s a sick piece of trash that most likely will serve jail time. About time.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "NFL Boycott In FULL EFFECT! 44% Of Americans May Stop Watching Football If Players Continue To Kneel… [VIDEO]\n\nWhat is going on with the NFL? What has happened to America’s greatest sport? The ratings have plummeted as of late, though definitely not enough to make any lasting damage…that is until fans get completely fed up with the anti-cop attitude and 44% of them decide to boycott…but that’s just talk, right?\n\nWell that’s the word on the street and if it does happen you can thank Colin Kaepernick and the number of other players who are protesting racial injustice by refusing to stand for the National Anthem, or raising the Black Power fist, idiotically not knowing what that symbol means.\n\nLet’s see what the feckless Roger Goodell has planned when the people who line these player’s and the owner’s pockets with cash, completely abandon these creeps.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThere’s a recent poll going around that reveals that 44% of fans would actually go through with the threat. Now this is an internet poll, so take it with a grain of salt…just saying. It’s going to be a good time to see if they actually have any conviction.\n\nAccording to the poll, there could be a number of factors. Some stated the absence of Brady and Peyton was enough to get them to stop watching the games, while a healthy third of the poll said that the actions of Colin Kaepernick played a major role in their decision to not watch.\n\nWith further riots happening after recent police shootings, it won’t take that much to believe that the kneeling isn’t going to stop anytime soon. But how long can it go on? To what end is all this going? What’s the endgame for these knee jerk reactions to police shootings? Whatever it is, Roger Goodell is going to have to make a decision. Is he going to bring the fist down and fine players each time they disrespect our country? Or is he going to go along with the PC culture…\n\nMy money’s on the latter.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "State Department ADMITS Terrorists Are Posing As Refugees – Obama Moves To INCREASE Intake…\n\nObama has known from the very beginning that there are terrorists among the unvetted refugees he is bringing in. That was a certainty. He just doesn’t care. When he first said he wanted to bring in 10,000 refugees, I laughed. I told people he was planning on 250,000 and people laughed at me. Now he says 110,000 and I’m telling you, it will be way more than that and many of them will be ISIS connected. Obama is not only terraforming the US into a Muslim nation, he is deliberately bringing terror and chaos to our streets to destroy us. Just as he has done with race wars. It’s been the plan all along.\n\nNow they have the chutzpah to actually admit they know it, but they are still defending their actions. They have no intention of slowing down, much less stopping the influx. This is one of those areas that I agree with Donald Trump on… this must be stopped until we can adequately vet these people. Obama now knows that Hillary could lose, so he is doubling down on this and violence and death will follow.\n\nFrom the Daily Caller:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet Islamic State terrorists have tried to pose as refugees in order to gain admittance to the U.S., Department of State spokesman John Kirby admitted Wednesday. “I wouldn’t debate the fact that there’s the potential for ISIS terrorists to try to insert themselves,” Kirby said on Fox News. “And we’ve seen that in some of the refugee camps in Jordan and in Turkey, where they try to insert themselves into the population.” He was defending President Barack Obama’s plan to bring in 110,000 new refugees in the next year, a huge increase from the 70,000 the U.S. typically admits, saying the vetting process is “good.”\n\nAny sane leader after having their country hit with numerous terrorist attacks, many of which are directly traceable to refugees, would back off and consider their actions and the consequences. But not Obama. We got hit by at least three terrorist attacks last week and he went to the UN and went all out for bringing in far more refugees.\n\nObama hates America and he is a traitor to this country. Every action he has taken while in office screams that he is an enemy within. Yet, we are doing virtually nothing to stop him. Terrorism and dead Americans are the result of our apathy and complacency. Obama and his administration admit that this will end in terrorism. We know it will too. Why are we just letting this happen? Has America lost her will to fight and survive?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BREAKING: Dash Cam Footage Released – Shows Keith Scott Coming At Police With GUN In Hand…\n\nWSOCTV is now reporting that there is dash cam footage of Keith Scott getting out of his car with a gun in his hand and approaching police officers. The police are not releasing the footage currently… they can’t. This is an internal affairs investigation and the footage will be used in court. Until the attorneys clear it, that video won’t be released.\n\nIt sounds as though the guy had a thigh holster that had a gun in it that he pulled when he was approached. The excuse he didn’t know they were police officers won’t hold up either… they identified themselves as such when they commanded him to get out of his car. No book was found anywhere. The story his daughter is circulating to gin up racial animosity and riots is a lie.\n\nFrom Gateway Pundit:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet Charlotte police reportedly have video of Keith Scott exiting his car, moving toward police officers, with a gun in his hand. And now race protesters are beating cops, tackling reporters, rioting and looting stores.\n\nIncluding the Hornets team store at the arena. […] The protest leaders are encouraging the community to fight back.\n\nAfter Keith Scott came after a cop with a gun and was shot dead. […] Keith Scott wasn’t holding a book. He was holding a gun and had a holster strapped to his leg.\n\nCurrently, one protester is hanging on to life in critical condition after a second night of rioting. He was shot in the head by another protester. Cops and protesters have both been sent to hospitals and the violence is getting worse. The governor has now declared an emergency in Charlotte and the National Guard have been called in. A curfew is being considered as well.\n\nScott charged those officers before he was shot and killed. Chief Kerr Putney told reporters on Wednesday that Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott with a handgun and that Scott would not drop it after being ordered to do so. The officer that shot him followed procedure and did the right thing here. But it hardly matters… any excuse will do… any lie will do to start a race war and a riot. Charlotte exemplifies that.\n\nIn the meantime, the riots continue and it is only a matter of time at this rate until someone is killed. Looting is rampant and the media have been attacked and brutalized. A photographer was shoved to the ground and then protesters tried to throw him into a fire.\n\nThis is the chaos and violence Obama has been fomenting in our streets. It’s about to explode massively.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The riots have caused widespread damage, multiple police officers have been injured and at least one person has been killed. And Newton has had enough.\n\nHe held a press conference to comment on the riots in Charlotte and criticized the black community’s response to the recent shooting of a black man by police, which is what spawned the riots. “I’m an African American. I’m not happy what or how justice has been dealt with over the years — the state of oppression in our community,” he said. “But we also as black people have to do right by ourselves, we can’t be hypocrites.” He also slammed the violence of the rioters. “When you get a person who does some unjust things or killing an innocent person, killing fathers, killing people who have actual families, that’s real,” he explained. “I have a son. And a daughter I’m responsible for. And how they feel if one day they come home and there’s no more daddy? We need people to be held accountable is that’s all.”\n\nNewton also criticized the Black Lives Matter protesters for focusing too much on race. “It doesn’t matter the race,” he said. “I don’t see that through a black/white lens. I could look at you and be around you and I can tell if you’re a good person. There’s good people that doesn’t have a badge on, there’s good people that has a badge on.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nPolice aren’t all bad, Newton also claimed, something that likely infuriated the Black Lives Matter protesters. “We all know people who are in the police department. And we also know bad people that’s civilians, and just bad people who are police officers. That’s just life as a whole,” he said. “We all have to as United States citizens, just have to [be] accountable for what we do.”\n\nBut it was what he said about the black community that likely truly infuriated the rioters. “When you look at the most dangerous cities in America. You know Atlanta, Birmingham, Chicago, Miami, Louisiana,” he explained, “I know from being a black person there’s a lot black people who don’t do right by black people, so you can’t be a hypocrite and say, ‘Oh well, a white man or a white police officer just killed a black man.'”\n\nIt’s the kind of common sense outlook that more people need to have.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "SOROS Linked Group Has Plans to Register 8 Million “Global Voters” For the Candidate of HIS Choice\n\nLiberals like to talk about the secret figures funding the Republican party, but they have one of their own. George Soros has been funding leftist groups for decades, from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter. Rumors of voter fraud have followed him for a long time and it appears that he’s gearing up to do it again.\n\nA new campaign has debuted that claims it will end Trump’s campaign. Called the “October surprise that will end Trump,” the campaign says it will activate a “secret swing state” of over 8 million unregistered voters abroad, made up of both American expats and “global citizens.”\n\nInterestingly, the campaign wasn’t launched in the United States, but in London. Avaaz is a registered charity in the United States and is also one of the world’s most powerful activist groups — and, surprise!, has links to George Soros. The activists behind the campaign drove from University College London to Parliament in an open top bus, blasting Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA” while yelling “Don’t vote Trump!”.\n\nIt is illegal in the United States for registered charities to work with or for any presidential candidate, and Avaaz denies having any connection to the Hillary Clinton campaign. They were recorded yelling “Vote for Hillary!”, though. “Avaaz has created the world’s first, global, citizen’s get-out-the-vote drive,” a member of Avaaz explained. “The more people that share it on Facebook, the more Americans abroad will see it, and the more we will be able to stop the global threat of Trump.”\n\nThe view for the top of the @Avaaz Stop Trump battle bus in London. American music, balloons, flags & chanting @LBC pic.twitter.com/slsTFdQti3 — Rachael Venables (@rachaelvenables) September 21, 2016\n\nAvaaz chose to kick off their campaign in London because it has the largest concentration of American expats and created a new tool designed to show them how easy it was to register to vote. 88% of Americans living overseas did not register to vote in the last presidential election and Avaaz believes that this voting bloc would be mostly progressive. Over half of American expats in the United Kingdom have Master’s degrees and overwhelmingly donate to Democratic candidates. But it’s not just Americans living in Europe they’re reaching out to — their next campaign is in Mexico.\n\n1 million Americans in Mexico can stop #Trump's wall! #GringosAVotar campaign kicks off Sun 9/25 in Mexico City: https://t.co/Q68FjjJk7d pic.twitter.com/6tv7CES8Cy — Avaaz (@Avaaz) September 21, 2016\n\nWill the Soros machine be able to stop the Trump campaign’s momentum?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You approach the group and apply the brakes, wondering if they’ll move for you, but not only do they not make any effort to get out of your way, they start coming toward you.\n\nRemembering the Reginald Denny affair, you realize that you’re faced with two options: floor it and risk hurting one of the protesters, or stop and risk them hurting you, or worse.\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nMaybe it was the way I was raised, but I learned that if you feel threatened and you feel as if it ultimately comes down to you or the person who you believe is planning to do you harm, the answer is absolutely, 100% self-preservation.\n\nApparently, I’m not the only one with this set of beliefs.\n\nAn incident took place on the campus of the Eastern Michigan University that proves that if you try to shut down a road in protest, you do so at your own risk.\n\nWatching the video below, you can see that black protesters have completely taken over the street. One small jeep, however, clearly has places to be that aren’t right there at that moment. The driver hits the gas pedal and speeds forward, bumping over a protester.\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nIn case you were wondering if they were upset about the Charlotte shooting, the answer is “no.” Instead, they were upset about the words “KKK” and “Leave N*****s” painted on the side of the school. The words were removed and the school issued an apology, but it was too late, BLM was outraged.\n\nMake no mistake, it’s better to be arrested for running over a protester than to be killed and/or have your property stolen by them because they think they’re entitled to it due to someone painting some mean words on the side of a building.\n\n“Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6,” doesn’t only apply to protecting your home and family, but yourself as well. There is no good reason to stop while surrounded by irrationally angry people who just want violence to come to you and anyone else they deem “guilty” of whatever crime they’ve made up today.\n\nWhat would you do if you were in this situation? Would you stop, or would you put the pedal to the floor?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "What Texas Just Did Will Make You PROUD! – Obama Has 120 Days To Comply…\n\nI love Texas! I mean I really love their attitude. They are like the honey badger, they just don’t give a damn about what everyone else thinks. Governor Abbott is the quintessential Texan because he stands up and defends the citizens of his state EVEN if it means spitting in the face of Barack Obama.\n\nGovernor Abbott told Obama on Wednesday that Texas would no longer participate in his current refugee program because of the massive security concerns. Abbott has a right to be concerned since we had 4+ terrorist attacks over the weekend in the United States. Abbott doesn’t want to take chances that the hardly screened refugees settling in his state would have terroristic ideals. The Texas State Refugee Coordinator gave their 120 days notice of their intention to withdraw.\n\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement its services to help integrate newcomers into U.S. society are only provided after they complete stringent US security screenings. Currently the US Refugee Settlement Processing protocol is riddled with security holes and has already let dozens of extremist refugees into the US.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” the governor said in a statement. “The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the director of national intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” “While many refugees pose no danger, some pose grave danger, like the Iraqi refugee with ties to ISIS who was arrested earlier this year after he plotted to set off bombs at two malls in Houston,” Abbott said. “Despite multiple requests by the state of Texas, the federal government lacks the capability or the will to distinguish the dangerous from the harmless, and Texas will not be an accomplice to such dereliction of duty to the American people,” he added. “Therefore, Texas will withdraw from the refugee resettlement program. I strongly urge the federal government to completely overhaul a broken and flawed refugee program that increasingly risks American lives.”\n\nSo take THAT Mr. President!\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BlackLivesMatter Is Not A Group Of Protesters – They Are Terrorists, Here’s Why…\n\nThere is a large portion of the American population that does not believe that the Black Lives Matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives, rather, they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence.\n\nMatt Walsh from TheBlaze isn’t mincing words when he refers to the group as “terrorists.” He gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being.\n\nIf you support the message, but not the way BLM is going about spreading it, this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nHe starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in North Carolina.\n\nIf you’re a little confused about what’s going on in Charlotte, North Carolina, allow me to explain: a black cop shot and killed an armed black man, so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down a black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people. Make sense now?\n\nPerhaps that is an over-simplification, but he’s absolutely correct.\n\nHe continues:\n\nNo, I suppose it doesn’t. There are many questions that immediately come to mind. Questions like: Why are they claiming Keith Scott was unarmed when all of the evidence clearly shows he had a gun? And no matter if the shooting was justified or not, why are they shouting “white cops are devils” when the cop who shot Scott was black? And even if the cop was white and even if all white cops are devils (which seems unlikely, theologically speaking), why are they destroying their own community in response? And perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all: Why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence, mayhem and criminality a “protest”? At this point, it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single Black Lives Matter “protest” involves chaos and bloodshed. I almost said it “descends into” chaos and bloodshed, but that wouldn’t be quite accurate. After witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years, I think we can now officially declare that chaos and bloodshed are the point, not just unfortunate byproducts; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “devolving” into something decidedly less peaceful. The media keeps saying — as it has reported about every BLM riot before it — that Charlotte “started as a peaceful protest” and then became violent. But that’s like claiming a drive-by shooting “started as a peaceful jaunt through the city” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver’s side window. That may be true, in a certain sense, but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part, just as these “protests” are, from the beginning, merely a staging ground for savagery, looting and destruction. The riots are not aberrations. They are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of otherwise peaceful demonstrations. They are planned, coordinated and widespread. And they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident.\n\nRead the rest of his opinion piece here. It is absolutely worth your time.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I only wish that we had someone to match his strength, conviction, morality, and spirit. Instead, we have President Mom Jeans.\n\nToday, Bibi spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, which can’t be an easy thing for him to do. After all, an organization that puts representatives of nations who think Israel doesn’t deserve to exist in positions of authority isn’t going to look too kindly on the Israeli Prime Minister.\n\nBut now that I think about it – if you’re speaking to a group of people who pretty much hate you and your citizens, you are pretty well free to speak your mind plainly. Which is EXACTLY what Bibi did today.\n\nHere’s a clip of his speech –\n\n[iframe id=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/yI0peugSqK8″]\n\nHere’s more of his speech –\n\nFocusing on innovation, intelligence and water technology, Netanyahu said that despite the UN “deserving every word” of his previous criticism of the body, he was positive that Israeli expertise in these areas mean it has a “bright future” in diplomacy. Shortly after telling the assembled diplomats that they would soon change their voting patterns on Israel at the world body, Netanyahu openly called Arab states “allies for security, prosperity and peace.” “For the first time in my lifetime many other states in the region recognize that Israel is not their enemy, they recognize that Israel is their ally,” he stated. “Our common enemies are Iran and ISIS, our common goals are prosperity and peace.” “I hope that in the future we will work together openly,” he added, truly taking the growing regional cooperation out of the closet. In his address, just one day after meeting with US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the General Assembly, Netanyahu also focused on the “unbreakable bond” between the two nations. “Our unbreakable bond with the US transcends parties and politics,” he said. “It reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support of Israel among the American people, which is at record highs, and for which we are grateful.”\n\nThe truth is that women and minorities in Israel are the most free in the Middle East, which totally freaks out places like Saudi Arabia and Syria. They just use the UN to punish Israel for giving its citizens freedom and liberty, instead of forcing them to live under tyrannical religious extremist rule.\n\nBut just for fun – compare what women in Israel can do and have done (what PM Netanyahu talked about in his speech), to what women in Saudi Arabia have to endure.\n\nYeah, no contest. If, for some reason, I was forced to leave America and I had to choose to live in either Israel or some other Middle Eastern glorified sandbox, I would go to Israel, no question.\n\nShare Tweet Email address: Leave this field empty if you're human:",

Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.\n\nThis guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nA random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.\n\nThat seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?\n\nWell, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.\n\nWhile being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.\n\nThe group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.\n\nThis is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations.

    "content": "Congressional Black Caucus Now DEMANDING Crack Down On Police Officers Nationwide…\n\nIt would be foolish to pretend that all police officers are upstanding professionals. Just like any profession, there are many, many dedicated professionals and yes, there are some bad ones as well. Police officers are people and sometimes they make mistakes and sometimes they’re just plain bad people of low moral character.\n\nHowever, in a profession that requires people to literally put their lives on the line for the good of society, I feel comfortable asserting that while there are some bad apples to be found, the vast, vast majority of police officers in America are dedicated professionals worthy of respect and who should be offered a degree of freedom from unnecessarily second-guessing life-and-death decisions that must occur in a millisecond.\n\nBut don’t tell that to the Congressional Black Caucus…\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThe caucus is demanding that radicalized and openly-corrupted Attorney General Loretta Lynch step in to target police officers to help prevent officers throughout the country from reacting with deadly force to black men and women who pose immediate dangers.\n\nOf course, the caucus does not frame the discussion in exactly that way, but that is the effort all the same.\n\nReferring to recent high-profile killings of armed black men posing immediate dangers to police officers, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-CA, read the letter to the Attorney General outside the Department of Justice as the adoring media dutifully nodded in agreement.\n\n“The world is watching and we cannot continue to ignore these killings,” she grandstanded with the caucus standing in solidarity.\n\nThe letter urges Lynch to “aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children.”\n\nOf course, such a demand seems reasonable… if they’re truly innocent people. However, in many recent high-profile cases of blacks being killed by officers of varying ethnicities, the quickly-fabricated narrative concerning the conduct of the deceased radically differs from the reality of the situation that emerges after radicalized social justice warriors have already furthered a fictitious narrative that supports their manipulative media narrative.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Students Fight Back After Being FORCED To Change BBQ ‘American Theme’ – Because It’s Offensive…\n\nOne does not have to bleed red, white and blue in order to live in this country. However, whenever I encounter anti-American vitriol that masquerades as “enlightened” political correctness, I always wonder, “If you hate what this country stands for, then why do you live here?”\n\nThat’s the question that should be posed to those who have forced students to change a school event’s “American theme” because it is supposedly offensive.\n\nStudents at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey, were planning on putting on a themed barbecue event for fellow students and faculty. The theme was “America.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nAs students made preparations for the event, however, they were informed by staff that they would have to change the event as the patriotic theme was too “offensive.”\n\nThe staffer who issued the edict, Bischoff Hall Assistant Residence Director Ariana Rivera, claimed that, among other things, the use of Uncle Sam on flyers was too “military and recruitment-oriented.”\n\nBecause college students looking for a good pulled pork sandwich might instead join the Army? Doubtful…\n\nRivera claimed that the order came from the administration. When asked who was issuing the order, she replied, “To be honest, I’m not sure. I think it was administrative. I was told that our advertising was too ‘military and recruitment-oriented,’ because we had the Uncle Sam saying ‘I want you.’ I think? However, we saw other posters with that same idea, so I really don’t know.”\n\nThe event went forward with a watered-down theme and around 300 students were in attendance. College officials remained elusive and cagey about the reasoning behind the demands and claimed that the issue was a “miscommunication.”\n\nStill, students tasked with putting on the event have vowed to move forward with finding answers for why there was an issue in the first place.\n\nIn either case, what seems the most troubling is not just that there seems to be a pervasive element in academia that despises patriotism, but that people have become so comfortable with redundant bureaucracy that orders are passed-on mindlessly without ever discovering who is issuing such ridiculous orders and why.\n\n“Because we said so” is the mantra of all bureaucratic tyrants.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "It’s Just Days Before First Debate – And Hillary Gets More Bad News…\n\nIf you’re like me, you are eagerly awaiting the Donald Trump – Hillary Clinton debate.\n\nDon’t get me wrong – as a policy nerd, I am disheartened to see that America has embraced two candidates who rely hardly at all on policy discussions.\n\nTrump advances himself through no-nonsense rhetoric aimed at Americans who are very understandably frustrated with the current culture of political correctness and weakness that permeates every branch of government.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nHillary advances herself through lies, extortion and skillfully-crafted propaganda designed to hold out just long enough to dupe the American people into giving the unindicted felon a job promotion.\n\nStill, the debate should be entertaining as Hillary has a habit of melting-down when on-the-spot and Trump thrives off of pushing back against unfair assertions and unwarranted attacks.\n\nTo emphasize how this debate is likely to be different, consider how Trump would have handled Candy Crowley’s shameful advocacy she pushed in 2012’s debate.\n\nAs if going against Trump isn’t scary enough, Hillary is riding into the debate on a wave of ever-dropping polls. Most polls have had Hillary up considerably over Trump since the conclusion of the primaries.\n\nThen again, these polls have largely been rigged via selection bias and targeted samplings of respondents.\n\nThe Real Clear Politics average (which averages the results of dozens of polls) has Hillary up by a measly 2.1%. When we account for the “bias factor,” we can see that at best, Hillary is dead even with Trump.\n\nThe projections emerging from the polls indicate that given the downward trend Hillary is suffering, Trump is only a single state away from victory in November.\n\nThat means a lot can change.\n\nThe data is having an effect on even the most optimistic analysts. FiveThirtyEight has placed Hillary’s chance of winning declining from 70.6 percent on September 11th, to 56.8 percent on September 20th.\n\nWhile polls are becoming more and more meaningless (look at Karl Rove and his little whiteboard), the empirical reality is that Americans are souring on Hillary the more they learn about her whereas people decided on Trump ages ago.\n\nMany mistakenly believe that this is a two-person race. It’s not. It’s a race between Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and “none of the above.”\n\nThose who support Trump have supported him for quite some time. They’re dedicated and view him as an agent of change.\n\nThose who vehemently support far-left policies are still embittered by the railroading of Bernie Sanders and these vote do not necessarily translate to votes for Hillary.\n\nIn a direct, forced match-up between Hillary and Trump, it may be extremely tight. However, how many Democrats are just going to stay home rather than risk the embarrassment of having voted for Hillary?\n\nAn even better question: if Hillary cannot stand up to Trump in a debate, will that finally demonstrate to liberals the validity of what Trump has been saying all along? That she is too weak to stand for America at a time when our prestige is slipping on the international stage?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BREAKING: Sick New Email Has CONFIRMED Obama’s Strategy To Hand Election To Hillary…\n\nThe rampant corruption and fraud has gotten so widespread in our government and electoral system that the politicians don’t even try to hide it anymore. It’s massive and we just let it happen. I don’t support either candidate this time around, so I have nothing to lose (except my country and the Constitution) in this horse race. But it looks to me like the electoral tide favors Trump. With Hillary’s health and ever increasing stack of scandals, Trump seems to be the only alternative and that just pisses Obama off.\n\nAt a minimum, about 15% of illegal immigrants will vote in this election. It will probably be much higher in those states where they have relaxed or negated voter ID laws. The illegal immigrants they ‘accidentally’ gave citizenship to were no accident. This is part and parcel of their plan to terraform the voting demographic across the nation. Many of the refugees they are bringing in will also vote illegally. I’m sure they have been instructed to. This is about power and control for the Marxists.\n\nFrom Fox News:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet An internal Obama administration email shows immigration officials may be literally working overtime to swear in as many new “citizen voters” as possible before the Nov. 8 presidential election, a powerful lawmaker charged Thursday. The email, from a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field office chief and part of a chain of correspondence within the agency, urges the unnamed recipient to swear in as many citizens as possible “due to the election year.”\n\n“The Field Office due to the election year needs to process as many of their N-400 cases as possible between now and FY 2016,” reads the email, which was disclosed to FoxNews.com by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who chairs the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. “If you have cases in this category or other pending, you are encouraged to take advantage of the OT if you can,” the email continues. “This will be an opportunity to move your pending naturalization cases. If you have not volunteered for OT, please consider and let me know if you are interested.” Parts of the email were redacted before it was disclosed to FoxNews.com, but it was sent by the branch chief of the Houston Field Office District 17. It was not clear to whom it was addressed.\n\nIt’s not just the illegal and refugee vote either… the Democrats have started a huge push overseas to get Americans abroad to vote. Approximately 85% of them usually don’t, but that may change this year. They are actively being contacted and urged to vote for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThen you have the voting machines themselves out of Venezuela which I contend are manipulated for votes as well. Once again, you will see people bused in to vote at locations which is also not legal or ethical.\n\nAmericans are going to have to rise up at some point and stop this. We are no longer a free voting Republic… we now exist under the illusion of freedom, when in fact our elections are rigged and it matters not what or who we vote for. The email above shows how the Democrats are illegally padding the voter roles. There is literally nothing they won’t do to win this time around. And they don’t care who knows it. They think they are above the law now and no one will stop them. Maybe they are right.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Keith Lamont Scott’s Family Views Police Video Of Shooting – After Inciting NC RIOT, Now They Claim “No Comment”… [VIDEO]\n\nThe black man, Keith Lamont Scott, who was shot by a black police officer in North Carolina, was caught on dash cam footage getting out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster he was wearing. He got back in the car and then got back out again, brandishing the weapon at the police – brandishing does not mean pointing by the way. The officer shot and killed Scott because he was a clear and present danger to the officers.\n\nScott’s family has now watched the video from several angles showing that Scott did indeed have a gun and was threatening the officers after repeatedly being told to drop his weapon. Now the family has no comment and neither does their attorney. Sounds like a justified shooting to me. They lied about the book and ginned up riots there. Then they had a Muslim spokesman come in and incite violence. They should all be arrested as far as I’m concerned.\n\nFrom Young Conservatives:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet The family of Keith Lamont Scott, the black man killed by a black cop after being ordered repeatedly to drop his weapon, said “no comment” when asked after watching video of the incident if the police were in the right. If that isn’t an admission then their lawyer wouldn’t have told them to say “no comment.” Clearly, the video must’ve shown that Scott was not obeying police officers (which we already know to be the case). Had the family’s lawyers even for a second thought the cops were out of line, they would’ve instructed the family to scream bloody murder. Tell me I’m wrong. I’m not, but you can tell me anyways.\n\nThese riots cost the life of one protester and got not only other protesters hurt, but police officers as well. An emergency was declared by the governor and the National Guard had to come in. These riots will carry a heavy price tag.\n\nThe police chief says there is no definitive proof in the video that Scott aimed the gun at the officers. It doesn’t matter. He had it in his hand and would not drop it. The officer that shot him followed procedure and the video bears that out. That is why the family is not screaming bloody murder over the video. They saw that Scott was indeed a threat and that is why he was taken down.\n\nJUST IN: #KeithLamontScott family just reviewed police shooting video; asked if video supports police, attorneys say “no comment” @wsoctv — DaShawn Brown (@DaShawnWSOC9) September 22, 2016\n\n#KeithLamontScott attorney says family viewed several angles of shooting video as often as they wanted; body cam, dash cams, dvrs @wsoctv — DaShawn Brown (@DaShawnWSOC9) September 22, 2016\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Who Do You Think You’re Fooling BlackLivesMatter? Protest Vs RIOT – There’s A Difference, TAKE NOTE… [VIDEO]\n\nAnimals behave better than this. After the shooting of a black man by a black police officer, things spiraled out of control in Charlotte, North Carolina. Last night was a lot more peaceful, but the two previous nights were hellish. One protester eventually died after another protester fired randomly into the crowd and shot him in the head. Almost a dozen police were hurt as were numerous protesters. Bricks, bottles, rocks, plants… whatever they could find, protesters threw at the police. The police in turn used tear gas, pepper spray and flash grenades. It was a war zone.\n\nAll of this started when the suspect’s family starting spreading the false story that the man was unarmed and reading a book while he waited for his son to get home from school. No book was found, but a gun was. The man got out of his car with a gun drawn from a thigh holster. He got back in the car and then got out again with the gun once more. An officer shot him after he repeatedly refused to drop the weapon. His family incited violence and rioting as did a Muslim man who represented them. They should be arrested.\n\nFrom The Federalist Papers Project:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet Robert Gehl reports that rioters in Charlotte in their second night in a row rampaging the city tried to throw a photographer into a bonfire they started in the middle of the street. Local station WCCB reported in a tweet Wednesday night that its reporters witnessed “protesters” trying to burn the photographer alive. The statement was repeated by Marvin Beach, a reporter for WCCB on their live stream. Beach said the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. As The Daily Caller reports, it’s unclear exactly why they tried to throw the photographer on the fire, or why it failed, but the livestream apparently later captured police providing assistance to the unnamed photographer, indicated he was unharmed. The photographer was apparently white, raising the specter that he was targeted because of his race – There have been many cases of race-oriented violence during the two-day chaos.\n\nThe worst example of the barbaric behavior that occurred this week was when a white photographer was grabbed by Black Lives Matter goons who then tried to throw him into a fire and burn him alive. He was evidently unharmed, but that could have cost him his life. A statement by a reporter named Marvin Beach on WCCB’s livestream of the riots, said the station’s photographer witnessed the attack. It’s unclear why the effort failed, but WCCB’s livestream later captured police providing assistance to the photographer, indicating he was rescued without suffering grievous harm.\n\nWhat kind of monsters do something like this simply because of race? They are doing everything they say they are protesting against. This will not end well if it keeps up.\n\nThis is what you wanted, America.https://t.co/fLTyk3IrT2 — Roark (@Roark__) September 22, 2016\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO]\n\nImagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.\n\nThis is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.\n\nFrom Louder with Crowder:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”\n\nI think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.\n\nThese people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down. It’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BREAKING: Charlotte Shooting Footage Has Been Released – There Is No Denying The Truth Now…VIDEO\n\nThe wife of Keith Scott got the audio and some video of the police shooting her husband. You don’t actually see them shoot him, you just see the aftermath and her screaming at them. She kept saying he didn’t have a gun and that he was on meds for some mental impairment he had. Gee, did that cause him to wear a thigh holster and carry a gun? Regardless of her claiming he didn’t have one, you can plainly hear the officers telling him to put the gun down repeatedly. He got out of the car first with the gun and then got back in. The police were going to break the windows and he got out again with the gun drawn. That is when they shot him.\n\nYou can clearly hear her at the end yelling at Keith not to do something. He evidently did it and it involved the gun, which got him a dirt nap. I’m sorry, I have no sympathy for any of this. He deliberately would not obey repeated commands by the police and that got him shot.\n\nFrom Western Journalism:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet The wife of shooting victim Keith Scott was pleading with him not to do something in the final moments before his fatal encounter with police officers on Tuesday, according to a cellphone video recorded by Scott’s wife and shared by the family with The New York Times. Scott was killed Tuesday by Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C., police after a confrontation in which police said Scott became aggressive and was a threat to the officers. Police reportedly have recovered a gun from the scene that had on it Scott’s fingerprints and DNA. The cellphone video was given to The Times by Scott family lawyer Justin Bamberg. Videos taken by police cameras have been termed by the police as inconclusive in documenting what took place just before police fatally shot Scott.\n\nI don’t understand his wife either. There’s nothing that could have kept me from my husband at that point. And I sure as hell would not be stopping to video all of it. He’s far more precious to me than whatever lawsuit this woman is angling for. The media of course is lapping this up and painting his wife and him as victims. Typical.\n\nScott’s family, initially contended that he was carrying a book, but after viewing the police video on Thursday said it was “impossible to discern” what, if anything, he was carrying. They urged police to release the footage. “There’s nothing in that video that shows him acting aggressively, threatening or maybe dangerous,” said Justin Bamberg, one of the lawyers representing the family, said in an interview early on Friday. Well, you can’t see anything in the damned video, so I guess that is right. But you can hear the police telling him to drop the gun again and again.\n\nDespite law enforcement’s refusal to release any footage, Scott’s family gave a video recorded by his wife to NBC News. It aired on MSNBC less than an hour after authorities’ press conference ended. That was totally staged. I’ve lost all patience with this victim mentality that seems rampant out there… and I am beyond done with Black Lives Matter. The police can’t win for losing here.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Another Bloody Weekend In Chicago: 22 Shot, 2 Dead – Rahm Emanuel Weeps [VIDEO]\n\nIn less than 48 hours, over the course of this past weekend, 22 people have been shot, two fatally, in the city of Chicago. This, only days after Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s speech on violence in which he proposed more police and mentoring programs for “at risk youth”, meaning those who are doing the killing.\n\nThe only people at risk are the innocent citizens on the wrong end of the Windy City’s gangster’s guns. These thugs and killers are not “at risk”. They have already plunged to the depths of thuggery and evil. Hey Mayor, how about some programs for those who are truly at risk, the law abiding people of your city. How about a “program” that starts arresting and prosecuting thugs with illegal guns? We know Chicago is a gun free heavenly haven, right? Wrong. There are more guns in Chicago than in many third world nations. And speaking of third world nations, that’s what it’s like to live in the life or death neighborhoods of Chicago.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThe Mayor is calling for more police. And yet police are being maligned, killed, shot at, protested against and generally disrespected by the very people you are trying to help by sending them in. Get control of the gangsters and thugs in your city with a seriously tough anti-crime initiative like Mayor Giuliani did in New York during his term and watch the homicide rate start dropping. But words mean nothing when a six year-old girl is hit by gangster gunfire and someone’s cousin walking her three month-old loses her life merely by leaving the house.\n\nMayor Emanuel, your city will know you are serious when fewer people die. You are crying on stage, while the people are dying in the streets. Seems inappropriate not to mention useless. Do something Mr. Mayor. We’re waiting.\n\nEmanuel’s full speech below:\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down\n\nA couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?\n\nNow a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”\n\nThen on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”\n\nCommon sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:\n\nPerry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "OUTRAGE! Obama Spends $770M Dollars In Tax Payer Money To Renovate Mosques Over Seas… [VIDEO]\n\nCBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.\n\nSet aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.\n\nFrom TruthFeed:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet “You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.\n\nMany of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.\n\nThe State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.\n\nLet me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic. This is a coup from without and from within… the enemy is now among us.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BOOM! Marines Send TERRORISTS Scathing Message [VIDEO]\n\nThere’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.\n\nWhile the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.\n\nA series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nConsidering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?\n\nAnd this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.\n\nSorry, ISIS. Game over.\n\nShare this on Facebook if you agree with this badass statement!\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BOOM! Charlotte Officials FINALLY Silence Rioters With One E P I C Announcement! [VIDEO]\n\nThe rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.\n\nOfficials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.\n\n“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nWill this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.\n\nOfficials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in Charlotte.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "OUTRAGE! Judge Rules to Keep Hillary’s Secret Emails Hidden From Voters Until AFTER Election Day! [VIDEO]\n\nVoters want to know what happened with Hillary Clinton and her e-mails. And the issue won’t go away… partly because officials keep doing all they can to cover for Hillary and make sure she avoids prosecution. They’re dragging it out and trying to block people from seeing her e-mails. They want to make sure that people vote before they can see them… and thanks to one judge, that effort is now a success.\n\nA federal judge just ruled that her e-mails won’t be released to the public until after election day. The FBI recovered a number of e-mails during their investigation into her server scandal, but the majority of them will remain secret for the time being. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is pointing the finger squarely at the Obama administration, blaming them for the delay in releasing the content of the e-mails. “This is an absolutely corrupt process the State Department has come up with,” he said.\n\nSo, what is in these e-mails that is making so many people in the Obama administration work so hard to keep them hidden? She must have some pretty scandalous and controversial stuff in there that could ruin her chances of winning. And Obama has already declared Hillary as his successor, so he is clearly not going to let her campaign go down in flames.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nHillary Clinton is one of the most corrupt politicians in existence. Most people know that already. But what is so worrying here is that she is evidently able to control both the FBI and the Department of Justice to keep herself out of jail, along with God knows how many federal judges. At this point, why even bother pretending that she’s held to the same laws as the rest of us puny citizens?\n\nAnd as if this all wasn’t bad enough, there are people who want to vote for her… so that she can become president and have even more power and influence than she already does. How crooked and criminal does Hillary need to be before these people wake up and realize what a catastrophe she is?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BREAKING: Steps to FORCE FBI Director Comey to Resign In Process – Hearing Decides His Fate Sept 28\n\nThe FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”\n\nDiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nWill Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.\n\nCongress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.\n\nHow loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? And if the answer to that question is “yes,” then the new question becomes… why?\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hillary’s TOP Donor Country Just Auctioned Off ISIS Sex Slaves…\n\nWhy in the hell do we still support Saudi Arabia? We don’t need their oil… we would make do. The majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, as does the Bin Laden family. The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. She’s taking money from a stone cold enemy and that’s not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country… period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?\n\nNow it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?\n\nFrom Jihad Watch:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet It isn’t news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves – especially Yazidi girls – but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being “sold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.” An eyewitness reported: Dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only Iraqis and Syrians trading women but also Saudis and Westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State’s practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State’s human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be ‘kafir’, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.\n\nAs these women are ‘rescued’ from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather.\n\nI have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Let’s not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A schoolyard fight was caught on camera again, but it goes down quite differently than what you would expect, based off the first couple seconds of the brutal recording. One part that will have you disgusted with the tactics used by two bullies and another part will reveal that racist hate groups like BlackLivesMatter and The New Black Panthers aren’t as influential as the liberal media would have you believe.\n\nYou are going to witness how the color of one’s skin doesn’t keep you segregated as these hate groups would have you think and believe.\n\nAs the clip opens up, a white male student is seated at a bench on school property, playing with his phone, when all of the sudden, two black students swing on him from behind. The first punch lands square on the kid’s jaw and he’s left with the only option of curling up in a defensive position. The two bullies are throwing punches as fast as they can, hitting their victim anywhere they can connect.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nAll seems lost for the victim at first…until two students, one male and one female, step in to even the odds and protect the defenseless boy. Oh, and guess what? They’re black.\n\nNow, it shouldn’t be a surprise to the majority of Americans living today that these two good Samaritans would stick up for another white student. The color of one’s skin isn’t a measure of the heart and if you don’t believe that, you are either a progressive racist, or you are an elderly racist living out life in the past. That’s not American.\n\nThese two sheepdogs didn’t give a crap about the color of skin. They saw a sheep being devoured by wolves and they came roaring in to protect him. These two are truly heroes.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "If You Want The Truth About Whose ‘Lives Matter’- You Need To See This Video\n\nAs we watch police officers hunted down and assassinated, and we see riots rear up every time a black man is shot by police, we might want to take a moment to review the actual numbers behind these shootings. The number of lives lost by police using deadly force is minuscule. Since it is an act of last resort, it should be. Twice as many white suspects are killed in violent encounters with police, but you never hear about that. See the statistics below.\n\nIf black lives mattered so much to the radicals out there, they would focus more on reducing crime and helping their communities. They don’t… the likes of Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam riot, loot and kill, many times in their own neighborhoods. It’s the violence and chaos they want… not to rectify any injustice.\n\nFrom Freedom Daily:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet 2013 U.S. population is 316,128,839 persons, here are annual percentages:\n\n⦁ 0.012% of the U.S. population committed suicide\n\n⦁ 0.011% of the U.S. population died in a vehicle crash\n\n⦁ 0.004% of the U.S. population died in a criminal homicide\n\n⦁ 0.00012% of the U.S. population died from police use of force\n\n⦁ 0.00012% of the U.S. population was struck by lightning\n\n⦁ 0.00009% of the U.S. population was legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense …that of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012:\n\n⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males\n\n⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males\n\n⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races\n\n⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females\n\n⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females\n\n⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males.\n\n⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen.\n\n⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males\n\n⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male\n\n⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males*\n\nPolice officers put their lives on the line each and every day they go out there to protect us. They never know if it will be their last. They have sworn an oath that all lives matter and they will protect people from those that are criminally inclined and evil. There are very few ‘bad’ cops and they are usually weeded out. The majority of officers are those who joined to help others and keep them from harm.\n\nYou have about as much chance of being struck by lightning as you do being shot by a police officer. You really have to work at it to become a statistic. Those that are shot almost without fail are threatening police officers or not obeying commands. The statistics tell the story if anyone bothers to review them. Violence is out of control in the black community and overwhelmingly when a person is shot, it is justified. And it happens very rarely.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Navy Seal Does What Others REFUSE To, Fact Checks Hillary’s Debate Comments On ISIS…\n\nI just could not stomach that debate last night. In the first ten minutes, I heard nothing but horrific socialist drivel from Hillary Clinton. Then Trump immediately chimed in with protectionism and tariffs. Both want socialist policies. It’s just stomach churning. Trump says he’ll release his tax returns if Clinton releases her deleted emails. We’ll never see either one. Both candidates say they are for taking Second Amendment rights from those on the No-Fly list which is heavily flawed and the whole concept is unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, the issue of ISIS was blood boiling. Trump screwed up big time: “No wonder you have been fighting ISIS your entire adult life,” he told Clinton. ISIS came into being around 2003 after the Iraq War. Unless she’s 13 years-old, that was just flat wrong. But even worse was Hillary’s faux paux where she blustered: “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Exactly backwards and SEAL Team Six member Robert O’Neill called her on it.\n\nFrom Independent Journal Review:\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet During the debate on Monday night, Hillary weighed in on how we need to take down ISIS. She said we need to: “Take out ISIS in Iraq and squeeze them in Syria.” Veteran and SEAL Team Six member Robert O’Neill, who was part of the mission to kill Bin Laden, found something off about her comments. So he called her out for it:\n\nWe should wipe out ISIS everywhere, but especially in Syria where they are headquartered. They are spreading into Iraq, not the other way around. Clinton also seemed to intimate that she took out bin Laden. O’Neill shot him with the backup of his SEAL team… Clinton and Obama merely watched and had almost nothing to do with it.\n\nLester Holt was a disgrace too. Not only did he not bring up Benghazi or the emails, he let both candidates blather on issues where they got multiple points wrong. It was a waste of a debate. Trump let Hillary slide on most issues. Both gave the same old talking points. One of them will be president and I guess we certainly get what we deserve in that department. We’ve richly earned it and begged for it.\n\nDon’t even get me started on Ted Cruz fawning over Trump’s lackluster performance last night. It’s disillusioning in the extreme. Cruz made that bed though and now he’s lying in it.\n\nI agree with SooperMexican: “There are no more heroes, there is only booze.” Looks like it’s going to be a predictable, boring apocalypse.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "BAD NEWS – Guess Who Snopes’ Fact Checker REALLY Is — You Won’t Believe It\n\nSnopes.com has long been regarded as the gold standard for fact-checking internet myths, hoaxes and viral stories. When you see your friends share something that seems kind of crazy, you can visit Snopes and get the truth. Or can you?\n\nThere have been allegations of liberal bias at Snopes. They only added political fact-checking to their site relatively recently and it is not often honest. Instead, it tends to be about putting liberal spin on issues that Democrats need to have covered. And now we know why: their lead fact-checker is a failed liberal blogger.\n\nLaCapria originally tried to begin her blogging career at the Inquisitr, a site ironically known for its hoaxes, fake quotes and satire. She was not successful there, perhaps due to her open liberal bias. She referred to members of the Tea Party as “teahadists,” for example. So of course, that bias bleeds over into her “fact checking.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nTake Facebook, for example. It’s known now that Facebook employees were made to hide conservative stories that were trending. LaCapria, however, discounted this as just “rumors.” When Hillary made her, “We didn’t lose a single person in Beghazi” gaffe, LaCapria dismissed that as well, suggesting that Hillary was referring to a 2011 invasion, rather than the 2012 attack.\n\nIt goes on and on with LaCapria and at Snopes in general. While they may do a good job at debunking UFO rumors and internet hoaxes, they perhaps should leave politics alone, as they clearly can’t leave their bias at the door.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Wife of Keith Scott: “He Kicked Me and Threatened to Kill Us Last Night With His Gun” [VIDEO]\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation surrounding the shooting death of Keith Scott at the hands of Charlotte police. The police department says the shooting was justified, as Scott had a gun and threatened officers. Scott’s defenders say that he was merely waiting to pick up his children from their bus stop and was holding a book, not a gun. What is the truth?\n\nIt’s still unclear, but a new revelation from Scott’s wife may shed some more light on what really happened.\n\nThe media has begun to dig into Scott’s background and found that Rakeyia Scott took out a restraining order against him, claiming that he was abusive. She also said that he had a gun and threatened to kill her. In it, she wrote, “He hit my 8 year-old in the head a total of three times with is [sic] fist… .He kicked me and threaten [sic] to kill us last night with his gun. He said he is a ‘killer’ and we should know that.”\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nThe form also asked if there was any reason law enforcement officers should view him as a potential threat and if he carries a weapon. She answered “yes” and wrote, “He carries a 9mm black.”\n\nThe order was filed October 9th, 2015 and less than two weeks later, Scott voluntarily cancelled it herself. But it certainly lends credence to the department’s claim that Scott was armed and dangerous. Police also released the dashcam and bodycam footage from the shooting, as well as photos of the handgun Scott had on him at the time. The gun was allegedly the same weapon that another homeowner reported as stolen after someone broke into their house.\n\nAnd police dispute the notion that Scott was merely waiting for his children’s bus to arrive, peacefully reading a book and doing nothing wrong. They first observed him rolling a blunt, which was not a priority for them at first. But when they saw him hold up a gun, they took more notice and decided to arrest him, because the combination of drugs and guns is a threat to public safety. The officers, who were originally in plain clothes, outfitted themselves with marked duty vests and equipment so it would be clear they were police officers, and gave Scott multiple commands to drop the gun. He refused. Scott’s DNA and fingerprints were found on the gun, which was loaded.\n\nSo again, we have another case of the Black Lives Matter movement exploiting a justified police shooting and using it to spawn riots and violence in the name of “justice.”\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "All You Need To Know About The Debate In ONE Article – SCANDALS And All…\n\nOkay, I have to admit that last night I ONLY watched the debate to see Hillary have a seizure, collapse at the podium or go into a weird coughing fit like she does. None of those things happened. As a matter of fact everything about her look was flawless… makeup, wrinkles (where did they go my mom asked), new highlights, perfectly coiffed hair. I wondered how after months of strange episodes of coughing fits, falling, unable to walk up stairs without help, shuddering that looks like mini-seizures; how she was able to stand up for the entire debate without assistance. The first half of the debate, her eyelids looked heavy, but that went away about halfway through when whatever they gave her kicked in.\n\nMy friend Nancee Jones said that she “was disappointed in Trump tonight but? he was going up against a Politician (which he is not) and a CONGENITAL LIAR. I don’t know if she specifically LIED tonight (maybe about him supporting the Iraq war??) but she is also a sociopath. There are two more debates and I DO PRAY he comes in better prepared and can get some zingers in there on those.” I agree, I was excited to watch Trump the first half, but then whatever Hillary took (conjecture) kicked in, she was like a general on a warpath. She didn’t care that her red suit already made her look aggressive, she allowed the claws to come out. She did an excellent job baiting Trump and the poor untrained debater, Trump, took that bait every time.\n\nDespite everyone agreeing that Hillary got the better of Trump, even the Liberal panel from PBS News Hour looked downtrodden, even dejected over her performance. Yes, Hillary won, but they complained that Hillary didn’t put out anything substantive. They didn’t feel the ‘leg tingle’ so to speak about her performance. They didn’t even look very enthusiastic that she had just wiped the floor with Trump’s expensive blond hair (that is NOT a hairpiece, I’ve seen it in person).\n\nEven Liberal CNN’s David Gergen said that Hillary didn’t do ENOUGH. Headline for his recent post states that: ‘Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough?’ Coming into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election. Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively, but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. For one thing, Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards. They have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver for so long that they crave something different. They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias. Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nEqually to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters. She has been vexed with the issue of likability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully.\n\nWhile Hillary ‘won’ because her ‘arguing was good’, she lost because even her own people don’t feel a ‘connection’ to her. Of course they wouldn’t, she’s a monster. Someone else was happy that Hillary turned up such a turd at the debate and he doesn’t get to vote for either candidate. My favorite fact about the debacle last night called a debate is that there are whole stories on what ‘Putin’ thought of the debate… because we really care. In reality, we don’t, we’re still ‘Merica but it’s funny to see how interested the world still is in the United States. Russia’s state-run media practically announced that: Trump Won Putin’s Focus Group and judging from Russia’s state-sponsored Twitter coverage of the presidential debate, the Kremlin is anything but a swing state.\n\nPresidential Candidates FIRST Debate 2016 Scandals\n\nGennifer Flowers: The first scandal of the debate erupted over the weekend as the candidates traded tweets over who they would invite to watch the debate live in New York. Hillary first announced plans to invite Mark Cuban, who has been critical of Trump, to which Trump responded with a threat to invite former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers.\n\nTrump’s quips are amazingly similar to the way I would respond to other’s nastiness. I really loved his twitter response:\n\nIf dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016\n\nHi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!… — Gennifer Flowers (@gennflowers) September 24, 2016\n\nPodium-gate: The next point of contention proves that “size does matter”, at least to Hillary Clinton. Last week, Hillary’s team demanded a step stool for their candidate so that the 5’4″ Hillary wouldn’t look small and frail beside the larger 6’2″ Trump. While the debate commission denied the step stool they did allow a “custom-made” podium which was presumably scaled down by exactly 14% to match Hillary’s relative stature…this is the status of American politics folks. Here’s a look at the podiums to be used last night:\n\nEar Mics: The next scandal arose out of the last Commander in Chief forum hosted by Matt Lauer in which Hillary was accused of wearing an ear piece so as to receive guidance from advisers during the discussion. According to the World Tribune, the issue prompted one Maryland voter to write a letter to the Federal Elections Commissioner, Matthew Petersen, seeking assurances that ear pieces would not be allowed though no such assurances were provided. That said, Carlos Greer, of the Commission on Presidential Debates, sent out a message to news organizations on Sept. 9 banning devices that would allow presidential debate moderators get directions from their news teams.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "headline": "BlackLivesMatter BOSS Comes Clean – Now We Know, Their Leaders Seek No Solutions…",
    "content": "BlackLivesMatter BOSS Comes Clean – Now We Know, Their Leaders Seek No Solutions…\n\nBlack Lives Matter released their platform last month that calls for defunding police departments, race-based reparations, voting rights for illegal immigrants, fossil-fuel divestment, an end to private education and charter schools, a “universal basic income” and free college for blacks. Based on this platform it is obvious that ‘black people’ don’t have parents or families to teach them how to take care of themselves and their own needs.\n\nBased on that ‘platform’ it comes as no surprise that Black Lives Matter got upset when an unofficial BLM chapter held a protest that turned into a cookout with the local police. The BLM made sure to denounce the chapter and event immediately:\n\nTrying to heal the wounds of a nation and come together by working together is NOT the goal of Black Lives Matter. In their tweet and many conversations about the event thereafter, they have revealed that their goal is destruction. They want to rip apart America by creating a divide between races which is essentially the goal of their major donor, George Soros. Soros is known for disrupting the economies of nations to profit from the unrest. This is why the major Black Lives Donor has given at least $33 Million in grants to Black Lives Matter through his Open Society Foundation and from the Center For American Progress. Soros funded political movement, Occupy Wallstreet, didn’t have the bones and anger to rip apart America because it was a bunch of people who don’t want to work. But the black community is a huge part of the thread of what is America. Soros’ attempt to create a massive racial divide between ‘white and black’ on the backs of familial deaths in the black community and blaming it on society instead of the individual looks like a winning movement.\n\nTo disallow communities to try and heal that divide is contrary to Soros’ plan. What happened in the Wichita, Kansas community was an attempt to close that divide.\n\nKSNW, the NBC affiliate station covering the area, said that the event, which was hosted by the Sunflower Community Action group, wasn’t just a lighthearted celebration — it was a way for the community to reach out to its police department to discuss issues surrounding police-community relations. The Wichita Eagle reported that “At one table, three men – a black man, a Hispanic man and a white man – sat down with burgers next to Lt. Travis Rakestraw to share their ideas.”\n\nBlack Lives Matter later responded to their initial tweet that the event was against BLM principles saying, “Our statement about BLM BBQ’s with police was a direct response to the tons of people and orgs who were upset by the event. We assured folks our principles were still focused on dismantling the system.” Dividing people by race, gender, age and religion is the key to dismantling the system. The ‘cops’ are the enforcers of ‘the system’ which is called RULE OF LAW. Without rule of law you will have dismantled the melting pot that is America. Who will survive the anarchy that Black Lives Matter are working for? Who is most likely to lose out? Inner-cities are most likely to lose out if anarchy replaces rule of law.\n\nTo end police brutality you have to end the police. — Brotha B (@BlakeDontCrack) July 22, 2016\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "People Noticed Something Odd About Hillary’s Outfit at the Debate Last Night\n\nThere’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.\n\nThere is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!\n\nThe latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?\n\nTwitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet\n\nIt certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?\n\nHillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.\n\nFox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”\n\nWhile we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”\n\nWoods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”\n\nThen Woods added:\n\n“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”\n\nOf course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.\n\nSome claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. We’ll let you be the judge.\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "The Lasting Damage Done by the Left’s ‘Favors’ to Blacks\n\nProgressive Democrats are the “helicopter parents” of America. They want to protect people so much that they end up doing more harm than good, and it’s keeping segments of the American population from being fully independent. This is NOT what our Founders envisioned when they set out to create our government.\n\nOne of the groups most negatively affected by liberal hand-holding is blacks.\n\nDon’t believe me? Just ask Thomas Sowell, who penned an amazing piece for National Review on this very subject.\n\nTrending: The 15 Best Conservative News Sites On The Internet Back in the 1960s, as large numbers of black students were entering a certain Ivy League university for the first time, someone asked a chemistry professor — off the record — what his response to them was. He said, “I give them all A’s and B’s. To hell with them.” Since many of those students were admitted with lower academic qualifications than other students, he knew that honest grades in a tough subject like chemistry could lead to lots of failing grades, and that in turn would lead to lots of time-wasting hassles — not just from the students, but also from the administration. He was not about to waste time that he wanted to invest in his professional work in chemistry and the advancement of his own career. He also knew that his “favor” to black students in grading was going to do them more harm than good in the long run, because they wouldn’t know what they were supposed to know. Such cynical calculations were seldom expressed in so many words. Nor are similar cynical calculations openly expressed today in politics. But many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks “favors” that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run.\n\nSowell continues his piece, lamenting the creation and maintenance of the “welfare state,” a term used to describe a government that acts as a parent of the citizen.\n\nIn 1960, before this expansion of the welfare state, 22 percent of black children were raised with only one parent. By 1985, 67 percent of black children were raised with either one parent or no parent. A big “favor” the Obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining of other categories of students.\n\nRead the full article here and be sure to share with your liberal friends so you can watch their heads explode!\n\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
